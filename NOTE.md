## Note on the Pedagogy of the Book/Workbook

Here we have an approach to education, where AI-assisted learning encourages exploration over
rote memorization. Traditional learning often emphasizes a complete understanding of theoretical
foundations before engaging in problem-solving. However, in practice--whether in research,
engineering, or real-world applications--learning is often fragmented, iterative, and exploratory.


### Expanding on the Idea of Learning Through AI Assistance and Projects

The premise of this book is that AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), will play an
increasing role in assisting learners. This changes the dynamics of learning by making knowledge
more accessible, interactive, and adaptive. Instead of following a linear trajectory--from theory
to application--learners can engage with problems first, using AI as a scaffolding tool to help
them (you) fill in gaps as they (you) explore.


__1. Learning Through Projects Rather Than Theoretical Mastery__

Traditionally, students are expected to understand the underlying theory before they begin solving
problems. This can be useful but often leads to over-simplification of problems to fit an educational
framework, rather than exposing students to the messy reality of problem-solving.

If we accept that deep understanding is not always a prerequisite for learning, we can approach
education differently:
- *Start with solutions rather than problems*. Instead of working toward a solution, students start
  from an existing solution and try to modify, critique, or extend it.
- *Understand in fragments*. Learners may absorb key ideas without grasping every detail immediately,
  and thatâ€™s okay. This is closer to how knowledge is built in practice.
- *Emphasize iteration*. Instead of one-shot problem-solving, projects encourage revisiting and refining
  ideas over time.


__2. The Role of AI in Dynamic Learning__

LLMs and AI assistants change the learning process in fundamental ways:
- *Personalized Explanations*. Students can ask AI to clarify concepts at different levels of complexity.
- *Adaptive Learning Paths*. AI can suggest different approaches depending on what a student understands or struggles with.
- *Project Guidance*. AI can assist in debugging, generating ideas, or providing historical and theoretical context.

Rather than merely providing answers, AI can serve as an interactive tutor that encourages learners to
experiment and think critically.


__3. The Value of Partial Understanding__

In traditional learning, there's often an implicit assumption that understanding is all-or-nothing--either
you fully grasp a topic, or you don't. However, real-world learning is rarely that clean. A researcher or
developer might work on a complex system where they deeply understand some parts but rely on tools, frameworks,
or colleagues for others.

If education embraces this reality:
- Projects can start from existing implementations and focus on modification, critique, and extension
  rather than always building from scratch.
- Students can explore different solution paths, seeing multiple ways to solve the same problem without
  needing a complete theoretical foundation upfront.
- Failure becomes part of the learning process. Not every project needs to end with a correct
  answer--sometimes, the struggle to debug or improve an approach is itself valuable.


__4. Example: Learning Dynamic Programming Through AI-Guided Projects__

Consider a student learning [Dynamic Programming](./workbook/ch03/dyn/) (DP). Instead of a step-by-step introduction
to the topic:
1. Start with a working DP solution (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, Coin Change problem).
2. Try to modify it to handle a variant of the problem.
3. Use AI to explain why certain modifications work or fail.
4. Compare different DP strategies, like memoization vs. tabulation, through experimentation.
5. Move from toy problems to real-world applications, such as reinforcement learning.

This approach mirrors how learning happens in practice: *partial understanding leads to exploration*,
which deepens understanding over time.


__5. References and Theoretical Support__

This approach to learning aligns with *constructivist learning theories*, particularly:
- *Papert's Constructionism*: Learning happens best when students are actively engaged in making things,
  rather than passively consuming information.
- *Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development*: AI serves as a "more knowledgeable other" that helps students
  tackle problems just beyond their independent capability.
- *Inquiry-Based Learning*: Encourages students to explore solutions before fully understanding them,
  promoting curiosity-driven learning.

This shift in educational design--toward project-first, AI-assisted, and iterative learning--can prepare
students better for real-world problem-solving. It acknowledges that full understanding isn't always
required at every stage and that learning is often messy, interactive, and dynamic.

To quote John Dewey, *Experience and Education* (1938), ed. (1963), pp. 19-20:

> If one attempts to formulate the philosophy of education implicit in the practices of the new education, we may, I think,  discover certain common principles [...] To imposition from above is opposed expression and cultivation of individuality; to external discipline is opposed free activity; to learning from texts and teachers, learning through experience; to acquisition of isolated skills and techniques by drill is opposed acquisition of them as means of attaining ends which make direct vital appeal; to preparation for a more or less remote future is opposed making the most of the opportunities of present life; to static aims and materials is opposed acquaintance with a changing world [...].
