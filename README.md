# From Basics To Bytecode: A guide to computers and programming

This repository is primarily to be used as a companion to the upcoming book
*From Basics To Bytecode: A guide to computers and programming*.

Here you should be able to find more information, errata, exercises, code,
other resources and updates.


A teaser for the book in PDF: [From Basics to Bytecode](./book/README.md).

Some of the [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)
podcast episodes have been produced, here on
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6urznNfbNTV33HOPJ7mcbQ?si=U1r_G6ySSGmQCHZqvbL4bw).

The [workbook](./workbook) consists mainly of:

* Examples in __*code*__ that were both too extensive to be published in
the book, and complete code. The code has also been described in text at
places where it may add to previous code and description.

* Also ideas for additional __*projects*__, some discussions and exercises
can be found.

A [Teacher's Manual](./TEACH.md) gives some advice on how to use the
book/workbook in a classroom setting, or equivalent.
