This book is an experiment. It is an exploratory book, designed to guide readers
from already acquired fundamentals of programming to complex real-world
applications, with an emphasis on learning by doing. It builds upward from basic
concepts, encouraging readers to engage deeply with both small-scale and
large-scale programming environments. And it assumes using Large Language
