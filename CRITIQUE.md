### Arguments Against the Method & Counter-Counterarguments  

#### 1. Fragmented Theoretical Understanding

Argument: Introducing theory reactively ("just-in-time") risks creating knowledge gaps. Students may miss
foundational concepts not directly encountered in projects, leading to a patchwork understanding
of computer science.

Counter-Counterargument:  
- Contextual Reinforcement: Theory encountered during problem-solving is more memorable and actionable.
  For example, learning hash tables *while* resolving collisions in a project cements understanding
  better than abstract lectures.  
- Structured Theory Capsules: Instructors curate projects to systematically cover core concepts,
  ensuring no critical gaps. Follow-up readings and reflections explicitly connect practical work
  to broader theory.  
- Spiral Curriculum: Later modules revisit concepts in new contexts (e.g., recursion in algorithmic
  thinking → recursion in memory management), reinforcing fundamentals organically.  


#### 2. AI Dependency  

Argument: Overuse of AI tools might cripple independent problem-solving skills, turning students into
"prompt engineers" rather than thinkers.  

Counter-Counterargument:  
- Guided Critical Engagement: The method mandates documenting AI interactions and defending modifications
  (e.g., *"Explain why you rejected the AI's suggestion to use a linked list here"*). This mirrors
  professional code reviews.  
- Tool Literacy, Not Reliance: Students learn to treat AI like a senior developer--a resource to consult,
  not obey. For instance, requiring comparisons of multiple AI responses trains discernment.  
- Progressive Weaning: Early projects allow liberal AI use; later stages restrict it (e.g.,
  *"Implement this feature without AI, then compare your solution to an AI-generated one"*).


#### 3. Cognitive Overload  

Argument: Novices may drown in complex codebases, struggling to distinguish essential patterns
from noise.  

Counter-Counterargument:  
- Scaffolded Complexity: Starter code is *designed* to be "minimally complete but maximally extendable."
  For example, a memory allocator with fixed-size blocks focuses attention on one flaw
  (e.g., fragmentation) at a time.  
- Just-in-Time Simplification: Instructors provide "surgical" comments
  (e.g., *"Focus on lines 24-38—this loop is where the slowdown happens"*) to reduce noise.
- Pair Programming Buffers: Collaborative work distributes cognitive load, letting peers explain
  confusing sections in relatable terms.  


#### 4. Subjective Assessment  

Argument: Process-oriented grading (e.g., reflection journals, AI logs) is inherently subjective
and inconsistent compared to automated code tests.

Counter-Counterargument:  
- Rubrics with Anchored Criteria: Detailed rubrics specify observable behaviors
  (e.g., *"Student compared ≥3 AI suggestions in their debugging log"*), reducing bias.
- Triangulated Evaluation: Portfolios combine code, reflections, peer feedback,
  and theory responses. This multi-source approach offsets individual grader subjectivity.  
- Real-World Alignment: Software engineering roles prioritise communication and process
  (e.g., design docs, code reviews)--skills this method assesses directly.  


#### 5. Equity Concerns  

Argument: Students without reliable AI access (due to cost, connectivity, or disability)
face unfair disadvantages.

Counter-Counterargument:  
- Institutional Support: Schools provide lab access, AI tool subscriptions, and offline
  alternatives (e.g., curated prompt-response libraries).  
- Collaborative Filtering: Pair programming and group work ensure all students engage
  with AI insights, even if not individually.  
- Critical Thinking Primacy: Core activities
  (e.g., *"Debug this without AI first, then use AI to refine"*) ensure foundational
  skills aren't AI-dependent.  


#### 6. Instructor Burnout  

Argument: Developing iterative projects, personalised pathways, and AI-integrated curricula
demands unsustainable effort from educators.  

Counter-Counterargument:  
- Shared Resource Pools: The manual advocates for community-driven repositories
  (e.g., shared starter code, challenge banks), distributing development labor.  
- AI-Assisted Curation: Instructors use AI to generate project variations
  (e.g., *"Create three versions of this parser with different bugs"*), speeding up prep.  
- TA/Student Co-Creation: Advanced students contribute to materials
  (e.g., building new starter projects), fostering leadership while reducing faculty workload.  


#### 7. Shallow Iteration  

Argument: Students might treat iterations as minor tweaks (e.g., renaming variables) rather than deep restructuring.

Counter-Counterargument:
- Structured Refactoring Tasks: Challenges specify transformational goals
  (e.g., *"Reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)"*), forcing meaningful change.  
- Process Artifacts: Submitting version histories (e.g., Git logs) and reflection prompts
  (e.g., *"How did your API design evolve across versions?"*) incentivise depth.  
- Graded Ambition: Rubrics reward high-impact iterations (e.g., *"Implemented a novel caching strategy"*)
  over cosmetic changes.  


#### 8. Industry Misalignment  

Argument: Overemphasis on AI collaboration might neglect legacy skills (e.g., debugging without modern tools).  

Counter-Counterargument:  
- Balanced Workflows: Projects include "AI-off" phases (e.g., *"Reproduce this bug fix without AI assistance"*)
  to hone traditional skills.  
- Tool Agnosticism: The method’s principles apply to any assistive tech, preparing students for future
  tools beyond today's AI.  
- Ethical Grounding: Modules explicitly address AI limitations
  (e.g., *"Why can’t AI automatically resolve this concurrency deadlock?"*), preventing overtrust.  


#### 9. Peer Learning Inequity  

Argument: Group work may amplify disparities if advanced students dominate pair programming.  

Counter-Counterargument:  
- Rotating Roles: Structured role swaps (e.g., *"Navigator becomes Driver every 15 minutes"*) ensure
  equitable participation.  
- Skill-Based Pairing: Intentional pairings match complementary skills (e.g., a theory-strong student
  with a debugger-strong peer).  
- Individual Accountability: Reflections require students to articulate their specific contributions,
  discouraging free-riding.  


#### 10. Rapid Obsolescence  

Argument: AI tools evolve quickly, making the manual’s specific prompts/techniques outdated.  

Counter-Counterargument:  
- Principle-Based Training: Focus on timeless skills (e.g., *"How to validate AI suggestions"*)
  rather than tool-specific steps.  
- Living Documentation: The manual's GitHub-based format allows continuous community updates
  to examples and prompts. (If you choose to follow that path.)
- Meta-Learning Focus: Teaching students *how to learn* new AI tools ensures lifelong adaptability.  


### Conclusion  
This method’s critics often underestimate its built-in safeguards: structured scaffolding,
critical AI engagement, and iterative validation. By treating objections not as flaws but as
design considerations, the approach evolves into a resilient, future-proof pedagogy. The
counter-counterarguments reveal that potential weaknesses are addressed through deliberate
pedagogical strategies, making the method robust against common critiques of project-based
and AI-integrated learning.
