*At the time of writing, the book is still in progress, so some details may change before the final version.*

[CRITIQUE](./CRITIQUE.md) presents arguments against a project-first, AI-supported learning method, highlighting concerns such as potentially *fragmented theoretical understanding*, the risk of *AI dependency*, *cognitive overload* for novices, *subjective assessment*, *equity concerns* regarding AI access, *instructor burnout*, the potential for *shallow iteration*, *industry misalignment* due to overemphasis on AI, *peer learning inequity*, and the *rapid obsolescence* of AI tools. However, the document also offers counter-counterarguments, suggesting that the method includes safeguards like *contextual reinforcement of theory*, *guided critical engagement with AI*, *scaffolded complexity*, *rubrics with anchored criteria*, *institutional support*, *shared resource pools*, *structured refactoring tasks*, *balanced workflows*, *rotating roles*, and a focus on *principle-based training* to mitigate these risks. The conclusion emphasises that these safeguards make the approach resilient and future-proof.

[LEARN.md](./LEARN.md) outlines a *project-based learning framework* that integrates textbook study with hands-on projects, advocating for learning by doing, incremental building, and a logical progression aligned with textbook content. It assumes familiarity with C, Python, and JavaScript and suggests project ideas for each phase, covering *foundations*, *virtual machines*, *development environment & tools*, *hardware interaction*, *compiler pipeline*, *philosophy & methodology*, *case studies*, and *advanced topics*. The document details strategies for project progression, effective learning techniques like *deliberate practice* and *integration projects*, and provides guidance on *using AI assistance effectively* for conceptual understanding, implementation, error diagnosis, and knowledge extension. It also covers assessment and progress tracking through checklists and portfolios, encourages community engagement and professional growth, and offers core principles and strategic techniques for AI-enhanced learning while cautioning against common AI learning pitfalls like solution-seeking and concept skipping.

[MISUSE.md](./MISUSE.md) presents a critical analysis of the *potential misuse of LLMs in educational settings*, warning against over-reliance leading to an *erosion of fundamental skills* like critical thinking and independent research. It discusses the *illusion of understanding* where AI-generated work may mask a lack of genuine comprehension, the challenge of *plagiarism and academic dishonesty* due to AI's content generation capabilities, the risk of *bias* and the reinforcement of existing inequalities, and the potential for the *"optimisation" of learning towards LLM capabilities*, neglecting other vital aspects. The document draws parallels with customer dependency strategies and the behaviourist "machine teacher" model, cautioning against *passive learning*, *depersonalisation*, and *diminished critical reflection*. It concludes by emphasising the crucial need for *responsible and ethical integration of AI* that fosters critical engagement and develops essential fundamental skills for authentic learning and intellectual growth.

[NOTE.md](./NOTE.md) provides pedagogical commentary on the book's approach, highlighting that *AI-assisted learning encourages exploration over rote memorisation*, contrasting with traditional methods that prioritise theoretical foundations. It explains that modern AI learns through pattern recognition, not fixed rules or simplistic rewards, and that the book treats AI as a computational phenomenon rather than a mechanical or behaviourist process. The document argues for *learning through projects rather than theoretical mastery*, starting with solutions, understanding in fragments, and emphasising iteration. It discusses the *role of AI in dynamic learning* by offering personalised explanations and project guidance, and highlights *the value of partial understanding* in real-world learning. An example of learning dynamic programming through AI-guided projects is provided, and the approach is linked to *constructivist learning theories*. Finally, it includes a quote from John Dewey on experiential learning and discusses how *assessment in this project-based approach should be continuous, embedded, and focused on the learner's growth and thinking*.

[TEACH.md](./TEACH.md) is a Teacher's Manual that guides instructors in implementing a *project-first, AI-supported approach to computer science education*, aiming to immerse students in realistic tasks from the outset, using AI as a thinking partner. It outlines the *philosophical foundations*, including *learning through modification*, *theory following practice*, *AI as a thinking partner*, embracing productive struggle, and iteration. It details the *implementation framework*, covering course and lesson structure, the appropriate uses and guidelines for AI, and instructor responsibilities in preparation, facilitation, and follow-up, including personalised learning pathways. The manual provides guidance on *creating effective learning materials* by designing functional, accessible, flawed, extendable, and authentic starter code, crafting meaningful challenges, and integrating theory through just-in-time mini-lectures, reflection, and theory capsules. It also covers *assessment and feedback* using process-oriented rubrics, portfolio assessment, and reflection prompts. Example modules for algorithmic thinking, data structures, systems programming, and software engineering are included, along with strategies for *facilitating collaborative learning* through pair programming and group reflection, and building a learning community. Finally, it offers *troubleshooting tips*, frequently asked questions, resources and tools, further reading, and implementation checklists, concluding that the goal is perfect learning and the development of confident and skilled students.
