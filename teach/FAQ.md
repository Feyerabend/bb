## Project-Based Computer Science Learning: An Integrated Approach

### Frequently Asked Questions TL;DR

__1. How does this project-based learning approach integrate theoretical computer science concepts?__

This method employs a "theory follows practice" principle. Students engage with practical programming projects first,
encountering challenges that naturally necessitate theoretical understanding. Instructors then provide "just-in-time"
theory capsules, mini-lectures, and reflection prompts that explicitly connect the practical work to the underlying
computer science concepts. This contextual reinforcement, coupled with a spiral curriculum that revisits concepts in
different projects, aims to create a deeper and more memorable understanding than traditional abstract lectures.
Projects are also carefully curated to systematically cover core theoretical areas.

__2. What is the role of AI tools in this learning environment, and how is over-reliance prevented?__

AI tools are intended to function as "thinking partners," akin to experienced senior developers whom students can consult.
They are encouraged for debugging assistance, concept clarification, exploring alternative approaches, and code explanation.
Over-reliance is mitigated through several strategies: mandatory documentation of AI interactions, requirements to justify
modifications to AI suggestions (mirroring code reviews), training in discerning between multiple AI responses, and a
progressive weaning approach where AI use is gradually restricted in later projects, encouraging independent problem-solving.

__3. How are students supported when faced with complex codebases in the project-based approach?__

To prevent cognitive overload, starter code is designed to be "minimally complete but maximally extendable," focusing
attention on specific flaws or features at a time. Instructors provide "surgical" comments to guide students to relevant sections of code. Collaborative work, particularly pair programming, distributes the cognitive load, allowing peers to
explain confusing parts in relatable terms. The incremental nature of projects, building from simpler foundations, also
helps manage complexity.

__4. Given the focus on process (e.g., reflections, AI logs), how is assessment made fair and consistent?__

While process-oriented grading might seem subjective, this method employs several safeguards. Detailed rubrics with
anchored criteria specify observable behaviours for different performance levels, reducing grader bias. Assessment is
triangulated through portfolios that combine code, reflections, peer feedback, and responses to theoretical questions,
providing a multi-faceted view of student learning. Furthermore, the assessed skills--communication, process, critical
thinking about AI--are directly aligned with real-world software engineering practices.

__5. How does the learning framework address potential inequities arising from differing levels of access to AI tools?__

Equity concerns are addressed through institutional support such as providing lab access and AI tool subscriptions.
Collaborative learning activities like pair programming ensure all students benefit from AI insights, even if they
lack individual access. Crucially, core learning activities are designed to ensure foundational skills are not solely
dependent on AI. For example, students might be required to debug problems without AI first, and then use AI to refine
their understanding or solution. Offline alternatives, such as curated prompt-response libraries, might also be provided.

__6. How does the project-based learning approach ensure students develop deep understanding and avoid merely making superficial changes to code?__

To prevent shallow iteration, challenges are structured with transformational goals that necessitate meaningful
restructuring rather than minor tweaks. Students are often required to submit version histories (e.g., Git logs) and
reflective prompts that encourage them to articulate the evolution of their designs and the rationale behind significant changes. Grading rubrics also reward high-impact iterations that demonstrate deeper understanding and application of concepts.

__7. How does this pedagogy move beyond potentially limiting behaviourist models of learning often associated with automated teaching tools?__

This approach explicitly frames AI as a tool for exploration, conversation, and reflection, aiming to transcend
the "stimulus-response" paradigm of behaviourist models. It aligns with constructivist learning theories, emphasising
active engagement in creating and modifying artefacts (Constructionism), scaffolding learning within a student's Zone
of Proximal Development (Vygotsky), and learning through experience (Experiential Learning Cycle). The pedagogy values
partial understanding as a starting point for exploration, encouraging students to experiment and learn dynamically
with AI assistance, rather than passively receiving information.

__8. How does the assessment in this project-based learning framework align with modern educational philosophies, such as those of John Dewey?__

The assessment is designed to be a continuous, embedded part of the learning process, rather than an isolated
end-of-instruction measurement, aligning with Dewey's philosophy of education as a "reconstruction of experience."
Assessment is manifested in the project work itself, focusing on the ideas, artefacts, and problem-solving processes.
Individualised feedback throughout the learning journey encourages reflection, revision, and internalisation,
fostering intrinsic motivation and a sense of ownership. This process-oriented feedback is considered integral
to the curriculum, guiding student engagement and thinking, rather than solely serving as a tool for sorting
students.
