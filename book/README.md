# From Basics To Bytecode: A guide to computers and programming

> .. it isn’t just another programming book--it’s a journey.

> Learn programming the modern way: not by memorising syntax, but by building, experimenting,
> and exploring how computers really work. From your first lines of Python, C, and JavaScript,
> you’ll dive into virtual machines, compilers, debugging, optimisation, and even hands-on
> hardware projects with the Raspberry Pi Pico.

> Along the way, Large Language Models (LLMs) become your interactive mentors—offering instant
> feedback, code suggestions, and explanations—while you push deeper into real-world programming
> challenges.

> This book is for programmers ready to go beyond the basics: to understand how code becomes
> computation, how abstractions shape software, and how AI is transforming the craft of programming itself.

> Steep? Yes. Rewarding? Absolutely.

> Build. Break. Learn. Repeat.
