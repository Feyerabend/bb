Certainly! Here’s a simple example of using a Kalman filter in MicroPython to smooth out a list of temperature measurements. This can help reduce noise in the measurements, providing a more stable temperature reading.

The Kalman filter is an iterative algorithm that estimates the true value of a variable (like temperature) by considering both the measurement and the estimated previous state. It’s widely used in embedded systems for filtering noisy sensor data.

Here’s how you could implement it in MicroPython:

# Kalman filter for temperature readings in MicroPython

class KalmanFilter:
    def __init__(self, process_variance, measurement_variance, estimated_error, initial_value=0):
        self.process_variance = process_variance  # Process noise
        self.measurement_variance = measurement_variance  # Measurement noise
        self.estimated_error = estimated_error  # Initial estimated error
        self.value = initial_value  # Initial estimated value
        self.kalman_gain = 0  # Initial Kalman gain

    def update(self, measurement):
        # Update Kalman gain
        self.kalman_gain = self.estimated_error / (self.estimated_error + self.measurement_variance)
        
        # Update estimate with measurement
        self.value = self.value + self.kalman_gain * (measurement - self.value)
        
        # Update estimated error
        self.estimated_error = (1 - self.kalman_gain) * self.estimated_error + abs(self.value) * self.process_variance

        return self.value

# Example list of noisy temperature measurements
temperature_measurements = [22.1, 22.5, 23.0, 22.8, 23.3, 23.5, 23.2, 23.7, 24.0, 23.9]

# Kalman filter parameters
process_variance = 1e-3  # Small process noise
measurement_variance = 0.1  # Assume some measurement noise
initial_estimated_error = 1.0  # Initial error in estimation

# Initialize the Kalman filter
kf = KalmanFilter(process_variance, measurement_variance, initial_estimated_error, initial_value=temperature_measurements[0])

# Apply the Kalman filter to the temperature measurements
filtered_temperatures = []

for measurement in temperature_measurements:
    filtered_temp = kf.update(measurement)
    filtered_temperatures.append(filtered_temp)
    print("Raw temperature:", measurement, "Filtered temperature:", filtered_temp)

Explanation of the Code

	1.	KalmanFilter Class: This class initializes with parameters for process noise, measurement noise, estimated error, and an initial value.
	•	process_variance: Represents the uncertainty in the process (e.g., how much we expect the temperature might naturally vary).
	•	measurement_variance: Represents the noise in the temperature measurements.
	•	estimated_error: The initial guess for the error in the estimate.
	2.	Update Function: Each time a new temperature measurement is read, we call update, which:
	•	Calculates the Kalman gain based on the current estimate and the measurement variance.
	•	Updates the current estimate by blending the previous estimate and the new measurement based on the Kalman gain.
	•	Adjusts the estimated error for the next iteration.
	3.	Example Usage: The code then applies this filter to a list of temperature measurements and prints both the raw and filtered values for each reading.

Example Output

For a list of temperature readings, you’d see an output like this:

Raw temperature: 22.1 Filtered temperature: 22.1
Raw temperature: 22.5 Filtered temperature: 22.3
Raw temperature: 23.0 Filtered temperature: 22.6
Raw temperature: 22.8 Filtered temperature: 22.7
...

This Kalman filter helps smooth out the noise, giving a more stable reading for applications where precise temperature control is needed.
