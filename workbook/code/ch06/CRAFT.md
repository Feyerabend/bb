## Methods and tools

*Approaching programming as a `craft` emphasizes a practical, skill-based, and iterative mastery that
combines precision, technique, and the development of personal style over time. Unlike the `art` view,
which leans towards creativity and abstract design, or the `science` view, which focuses on rigorous
methodology, the `craft` perspective is rooted in hands-on skill development, often shared through
mentorship, apprenticeship, and iterative refinement.*


### Arguments for Programming as a Craft

Skill and Mastery Through Practice: Craftsmanship highlights the importance of practice and iterative
improvement. Like woodworking or metalworking, where skills improve through repetition and accumulated
experience, programming as a craft underscores the importance of honing one's abilities over time.
This is achieved through solving real problems, debugging, refactoring, and learning through trial and
error.

Focus on Practical Outcomes: Crafts are valued for their practical, tangible outcomes. In programming,
this translates to producing code that works reliably in the real world, fulfills its purpose, and can
be maintained and evolved. Practical utility is prioritized, and the process is grounded in producing
high-quality, working software.  

- Emphasis on Code Quality and Maintainability: In the same way a craftsperson aims to create items that
  endure and serve well, programmers focused on craft value clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
  Craftsmanship in programming emphasizes longevity, where code can evolve without breaking and can be
  easily understood by others.

- Personal Style and Adaptability: Every craftsperson develops a personal style, built from preferences
  and techniques honed over time. In programming, this can mean adopting a specific way of structuring
  code, choosing certain tools or languages, or preferring particular design patterns. The craft approach
  values adaptability to different contexts, client needs, and team standards.

- Mentorship and Apprenticeship Models: Craftsmanship is often passed down through mentorship and
  apprenticeship, where knowledge and skills are directly transmitted from experienced practitioners
  to newcomers. This aligns well with pair programming, code reviews, and collaborative environments,
  where senior developers can guide and mentor juniors.


### Methods and practices for programming as a craft

Code Reviews and Pair Programming

Why: Like a craftsperson learning by observing and working alongside a master, pair programming and
code reviews allow knowledge transfer and provide opportunities to refine techniques and improve code
quality.  

How: Regular code reviews should focus not only on correctness but also on style, efficiency, and
readability. Pair programming encourages immediate feedback and a shared understanding of coding
standards and problem-solving techniques.


### Iterative refactoring

Why: Refactoring is analogous to a craftsperson polishing or refining their work. It allows for continuous
improvement and adaptation of code to meet changing requirements or improve clarity and performance.  

How: Make refactoring a regular part of the development process. Focus on removing redundant code,
simplifying complex methods, and improving readability and maintainability. Tools like linting, static
analysis, and style guides can provide automated support.


### TDD and Small, Incremental Steps

Why: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is like building small components of a larger structure and verifying each one's quality before moving on. It reinforces disciplined programming and helps ensure reliability.  

How: Start with small, testable parts of functionality, write tests for them, and iteratively build and test larger components. This keeps code manageable and helps catch errors early.


### Building Personal Coding Standards and Style

Why: A craftsperson develops a style and personal approach that reflects their philosophy and experience. In programming, this translates to consistent naming conventions, commenting style, or preferred design patterns.  

How: Develop a personal coding style based on readability and best practices. This can include specific naming conventions, consistent indentation, and clarity in variable and method naming. Adhering to style guides (like PEP 8 for Python) helps ensure your code is easy to read and maintain, even by others.


### Tool Proficiency and Customization

Why: Just as a craftsperson maintains and customizes their tools, programmers benefit from mastering and tailoring their tools to enhance productivity and code quality.  

How: Invest time in learning your IDE, command-line tools, version control, and other essential tools. Customize your environment to streamline tasks, automate repetitive actions, and enhance productivity. Configuration management (e.g., .vimrc or .zshrc) and custom scripts can save time and reinforce good habits.


### Regular Retrospective and Self-Improvement

Why: Craftspersons often reflect on their work to identify ways to improve. In programming, this means periodically reviewing past projects to learn from mistakes and successes.  

How: Set aside time to review completed projects or code bases and analyze what could be improved. Look for patterns in your work where you might consistently struggle or excel, and focus on refining those areas. Document lessons learned and incorporate them into future projects.


### Mentoring and Knowledge Sharing

Why: Craftsmanship traditionally involves passing down skills and knowledge. In programming, mentoring helps build a collaborative culture and fosters collective code ownership.  

How: Engage in mentoring opportunities, whether formal or informal. Offer guidance in code reviews, lead workshops, or provide feedback to less experienced developers. This not only helps the mentee but solidifies the mentor's own understanding and promotes good coding practices.


### Philosophy of Craftsmanship in Programming

The idea of "programming as a craft” isn't just about the technical skill but also involves a mindset of care, patience, and a commitment to quality. In practice, this means:

	•	Pride in Craftsmanship: Taking pride in the code produced and feeling a sense of ownership, not only in the final product but in the details of how it was made.  
	•	Learning by Doing and Repeating: Repeated practice, hands-on experimentation, and an openness to learning from mistakes are crucial. Like any craft, mastery in programming comes through hands-on experience.  
	•	Quality Over Quantity: Craftsmanship emphasizes the importance of producing high-quality work that stands the test of time, as opposed to cranking out quick, disposable solutions.  
	•	Continuous Learning and Adaptation: Programming as a craft involves a commitment to learning and adapting. Just as a woodworker might experiment with different woods or techniques, a programmer should be open to new languages, paradigms, and methodologies.

*Conclusion*

*Programming as a craft is about developing a mastery over one's tools and code while fostering habits that ensure quality, readability, and maintainability. This perspective values skill, patience, and constant improvement, and it blends the personal with the practical, encouraging programmers to take pride in their work and treat each project as an opportunity to refine their craft.*
