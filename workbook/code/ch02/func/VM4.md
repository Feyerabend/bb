This implementation extends the VM functionality to include support for frame-based management, including call/return mechanisms (CALL, RET, CALLV, RETV), local variables, stack manipulation (PUSH, POP), and mathematical operations (ADD, MUL). Here’s a breakdown of key elements and behaviors:

Key Features

	1.	Frame Management:
	•	Frames represent execution contexts (with their own stack and local variables). This allows functions (or subroutines) to have independent states.
	•	The FrameStack structure maintains a stack of frames, enabling nested function calls.
	•	pushFrame and popFrame manage frame stack operations during function calls and returns.
	2.	Call/Return Mechanisms:
	•	CALL: Pushes a new frame, stores the return address, and jumps to the target address. This is for calls without argument passing.
	•	CALLV: Supports calls that pass arguments by popping values from the current frame’s stack and pushing them into the new frame’s local variables.
	•	RET: Returns control to the previous frame by setting the program counter to the saved return address and popping the current frame.
	•	RETV: Similar to RET, but also transfers a return value from the current frame to the previous one.
	3.	Local Variables and Stack Transfer:
	•	transferStackToLocals moves arguments from the previous frame’s stack to the new frame’s local variables.
	•	transferStackToReturnValue moves a return value from one frame’s stack to another frame’s return value field.
	•	Instructions like LD (load) and ST (store) manipulate local variables by interacting with the current frame’s local variable array.
	4.	Instruction Set:
	•	Arithmetic operations like ADD and MUL pop two values from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back.
	•	PRINT outputs the top value of the stack.
	•	The HALT instruction terminates the program.
	5.	Error Handling:
	•	Robust error handling is built into stack and frame management to avoid overflows, underflows, or invalid access (e.g., accessing out-of-bounds local variables or stack).

Example Execution

The program starts by pushing 10 and 20 onto the stack, followed by a function call using CALLV, which transfers two arguments to local variables, multiplies and adds them, and returns the result. The result is combined with 80, printed, and the program halts.

Potential Improvements:

	•	The current implementation doesn’t support nested or recursive function calls that pass values through both CALLV and CALL. Enhancements could be made to unify argument passing across different call types.
	•	Debugging could be enhanced by printing more detailed state information, such as stack contents after each operation, to trace the flow of data during execution.

Overall, this VM design introduces a versatile and flexible stack-based execution model with proper function call management.
