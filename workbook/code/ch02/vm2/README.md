## VM2 Overview

The inpiration of this VM version comes from stack-absed programming languages such as FORTH. Moreover, this program implements a simple virtual machine (VM) that interprets and executes a predefined sequence of instructions for calculating and printing Fibonacci numbers. The main C file initializes the VM with a Fibonacci sequence-generating program, runs it, and measures its execution time. The VM operates on a stack-based architecture, executing operations like arithmetic, jumps, and stack manipulation, with custom commands such as TWODUP, ROT, and PRINT.

The C program is divided into a header file and a source file, demonstrating the typical organization of these components. A separate file (`main.c`) is the starting point for running the program. Also a Makefile is introduced to show how interaction between compiler and source can be handled.


### Features

The provided code is a minimal implementation of a stack-based virtual machine (VM) in C, designed to interpret a custom bytecode for generating Fibonacci numbers. It consists of three main components:

1. Main Program (`main.c`):
	* The main program initializes a VM with a hardcoded sequence of bytecode instructions stored in the code[] array. This sequence calculates and prints the first few Fibonacci numbers.
	•	The `program()` function creates a new VM, runs the bytecode, and prints the execution time. It uses functions from the `vm2.h` header, such as `newVM()` to create the VM and `run()` to execute the program.
2. VM Implementation (`vm2.c`):
	* The VM operates by executing instructions on a stack, where each instruction manipulates the stack in some way, such as pushing or popping values, performing arithmetic operations, and branching logic.
	* Functions like `push()`, `pop()`, and `nextcode()` handle stack operations and instruction fetching.
	* The `run()` function implements the VM’s instruction cycle, which continuously fetches and executes instructions from the `code[]` array until a HALT instruction is encountered.
	* Instructions include basic arithmetic (ADD, SUB, etc.), stack manipulation (DUP, ROT, TWODUP), conditional jumps (JPZ, JPNZ), and I/O (PRINT).
3.	VM Data Structures (`vm2.h`):
	* A VM struct stores the state of the virtual machine, including a stack, a program counter (`pc`), and global variables (`vars`).
	* Constants such as `STACK_SIZE` define the size of the stack, and an enumeration lists all supported opcodes for instructions like ADD, HALT, PRINT, etc.

The Fibonacci sequence generation works by:
* Starting with two initial values (0 and 1).
* Repeatedly adding the last two values on the stack and printing the result.
* Using control flow instructions (JPNZ) to loop until a predetermined limit is reached.
