Three example of code `vmo.c`, `vm02.c` and `vmo3.c` illustrates some object-oriented programming concepts in C, including dynamic memory management, the use of unions for flexible data representation, and basic VM execution models. They provide a foundation that can be expanded to include more complex operations and features, such as method invocation and more advanced data types.
