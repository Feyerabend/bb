## mem

## regvm

Two different virtual machines, one that uses stack-based operations, and the other that uses register-based operations. They thereby illustrates much of the difference between processors, CPUs, that used similar principals.


## vm1

## vm2

## vm3

## vmo

Three example of code `vmo.c`, `vm02.c` and `vmo3.c` illustrates some object-oriented programming concepts in C, including dynamic memory management, the use of unions for flexible data representation, and basic VM execution models. They provide a foundation that can be expanded to include more complex operations and features, such as method invocation and more advanced data types.
