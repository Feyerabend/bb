The Portable Pixmap (PPM) image format is a simple image format from the Netpbm family, which includes PBM (Portable Bitmap) for monochrome images, PGM (Portable Graymap) for grayscale images, and PPM for color images. PPM files are notably straightforward, designed for ease of readability and simplicity, but at the cost of larger file sizes and inefficient storage. Here’s an overview of the ASCII version of the PPM format.

PPM ASCII Structure

A PPM file in ASCII format, also called “plain PPM” and identified by the “P3” magic number, stores pixel data in human-readable text. This format represents each pixel’s color components as numbers in ASCII, rather than as raw binary values. Here’s the breakdown of the structure for an ASCII PPM file:

	1.	Magic Number: The first line of a PPM ASCII file is always P3, which denotes that this is an ASCII (text) PPM file.
	2.	Image Width and Height: The second line (or part of it, as whitespace can be flexible) specifies the image's width and height, separated by a space. For instance, 300 200 would mean the image has a width of 300 pixels and a height of 200 pixels.
	3.	Maximum Color Value: The next line defines the maximum color value (usually 255). This specifies the intensity range for each color channel (Red, Green, and Blue). If this number is 255, each color component can range from 0 to 255.
	4.	Pixel Data: The remainder of the file lists each pixel's color values in RGB order. Each pixel is represented by three numbers, with each number corresponding to the Red, Green, and Blue components. These values are separated by whitespace (spaces or newlines) and are written sequentially from left to right, top to bottom.

Example of an ASCII PPM File

A simple PPM file representing a 3x2 image with six pixels might look like this:

P3
3 2
255
255 0 0   0 255 0   0 0 255
255 255 0 0 255 255 255 0 255

This example represents an image that is 3 pixels wide and 2 pixels high. The maximum color value is 255, meaning each color channel for each pixel can go up to 255 (standard 8-bit RGB). Each line following that specifies the RGB values for each pixel. In this case:

	•	The first row has three pixels: red (255, 0, 0), green (0, 255, 0), and blue (0, 0, 255).
	•	The second row has three pixels: yellow (255, 255, 0), cyan (0, 255, 255), and magenta (255, 0, 255).

Pros and Cons

The ASCII PPM format is very easy to parse, because the structure is simple and avoids binary data. However, due to its human-readable nature, ASCII PPM files can become very large very quickly, as each pixel’s RGB values are stored as ASCII text. This format is thus more useful for small images, educational purposes, or simple debugging, rather than for actual image storage or transmission.
