## Projects

Here are some project ideas, some of which can make use of the items found in the collection
within the folder, while others will require you to create them from scratch. The first project
(1) focuses on visualisation and provides a few examples to get you started. Using LLMs, as I have
done in this case, can offer valuable insights into how trees and other data structures work,
even if the primary focus isn't on implementing the visualisation programs themselves. Instead,
the project shifts towards explaining abstract data types and gaining a deeper understanding
of them through practical examples and demonstrations.


### Trees & Heaps

__1. Visualising Self-Balancing Trees__
- *Structures Used*: AVL Tree, Splay Tree, Treap, Red-Black Tree
- *Project Idea*: Create an interactive visualisation tool for tree rotations and balancing.
  Show how trees adjust after insertion and deletion.

__2. Auto-Complete & Spell Checker__
- *Structures Used*: Trie (Prefix Tree)
- *Project Idea*: Implement an auto-complete system similar to Google Search using a Trie.
  Store words from a dictionary and return suggestions based on user input.

__3. Priority-Based Task Scheduler__
- *Structures Used*: Fibonacci Heap, Binary Heap, Priority Queue
- *Project Idea*: Build a task scheduler where tasks with higher priority are executed first.
  Use a Fibonacci Heap to ensure efficient extraction and updates.

__4. Huffman Encoding & Compression__
- *Structures Used*: Binary Heap, Priority Queue
- *Project Idea*: Implement Huffman Encoding for text compression. Assign shorter codes to
  frequent characters using a priority queue.



### Graph Algorithms

__5. Shortest Path Visualiser__
- *Algorithms Used*: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford, A*
- *Project Idea*: Create an interactive graph pathfinder to show the shortest route between
  two nodes in a city map.

__6. Social Network Connection Finder__
- *Structures Used*: Disjoint Set (Union-Find), Graphs
- *Project Idea*: Build a friend suggestion system using a Union-Find data structure to group
  connected users.

__7. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for Network Design__
- *Algorithms Used*: Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm
- *Project Idea*: Given a set of cities, design a minimum-cost internet network using
  Kruskal's MST algorithm.



### Range Queries & Search Optimization

__8. Stock Price Query System__
- *Structures Used*: Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree (BIT)
- *Project Idea*: Implement a stock price tracker that allows efficient queries for
  highest/lowest stock prices in a given time range.

__9. AI for Word Suggestion__
- *Structures Used*: Trie, Bloom Filter
- *Project Idea*: Build a fast dictionary lookup system that suggests words based
  on partial input.

__10. Spam Detection with Bloom Filters__
- *Structures Used*: Bloom Filter
- *Project Idea*: Develop a spam detection system that efficiently checks whether
  an email or URL is blacklisted.



### Abstract Data Types (ADT)

__11. Implement a Key-Value Database__
- *Structures Used*: Hash Table, B-Tree
- *Project Idea*: Build a mini database that supports fast insertion, deletion,
  and retrieval of key-value pairs.

__12. Search Engine with Inverted Index__
- *Structures Used*: Hash Table, Trie
- *Project Idea*: Build a simple search engine that retrieves relevant web pages
  for a given keyword using an inverted index.

__13. LRU Cache for Fast Data Access__
- *Structures Used*: Hash Table + Doubly Linked List
- *Project Idea*: Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache for optimising
  data retrieval, used in memory management.



### Advanced & Real-World Projects

__14. Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for Peer-to-Peer Networks__
- *Structures Used*: Hash Table, Skip List
- *Project Idea*: Implement a distributed key-value storage similar to BitTorrent.

__15. Machine Learning with Decision Trees__
- *Structures Used*: Binary Tree
- *Project Idea*: Build a Decision Tree classifier for basic ML problems like spam
  detection or loan approval.

__16. Implement a Version Control System (Like Git)__
- *Structures Used*: DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), Hashing
- *Project Idea*: Create a basic Git-like system where commits form a DAG.
