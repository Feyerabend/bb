<h1>Active agents and other concepts<h1>

<p class="start">
The concept of "active agents" is quite well known by this time. The
concept is <I>conceptually </I>rather easy, but it could be complex in
practice as well as theoretically mingled with other concepts. Think of
precisely human agents that travel between countries. They are as "agents"
of software that travels between "machines", i.e. computers and they are
executed. They are executed as they arrive, and can do things at the host
serving them and allow them to do -- which perhaps isn't the case with
real agents. When the software agents finally return to home they can make
their reports, they have now been performing their tasks that they were
initially given or failed to do so. Naturally, this is only one way of
dealing with agents, but it's perhaps one of the most easy to comprehend.
Make notice of that the agents could be free to do non-anticipated actions,
which on the other hand in the case of protocol-restricted execution, isn't
the case. Only what the protocol is capable of interpret can, by the allowing
rules, be executed. The former case is more the opposite: what isn't prohibited
<I>can</I> be done.

<h2>Client-server</h2>

<p class="start">
The concept of "client-server" is also a very convenient one. Local
machines have their own software. When connected to another machine, often
there are some protocols which are executed. And if not all the execution
of essential computation is done by the server, the connection is often
termed a <I>client-server</I> connection. Some of the executing software
is at the client, and some at the server. Then the client and server <I>interact</I>.
This concept can also be muddled and combined with other concepts.

<h2>Terminal-server</h2>

<p class="start">
Another concept of the connection-type is "terminal-server" connection.
Almost everything is supposed to be done by the server. The terminal is
often dumb, it doesn't do anything except being the interface to the user.

<h2>At least two developments</h2>

<p class="start">
Today, there are mainly two developments that are interesting from the
computational point of view. One is that the old terminal-server connection
has increased in its attention, but it has also been rather extended ("thin
clients" or instant operating system download). The other is that the client-server
connection has increased in interest. How come such different approaches
to the same area are both given attention? Let's return to the question
later.

<h2>Push and pull technology</h2>

<p class="start">
Inherently the web has been a "pull technology", i.e. you have till
now <I>asked</I> for "information". Electronic mail have been more of a
push technology: people or robots have sent information to you. Rather
recently though, it has also been added a "push technology" to the web.
The social implications (and communicational), which are the most imporant,
are however not new. They are old. There are perhaps <I>filters </I>which
let you sort out things you decide from the flow, which are more sophisticated
than the old media. But the difference is not a giant leap, as have been
advocated. It is a thin wedge to the already established television, radio,
newspaper and other masscommunicational media. I think the push technology
can establish itself only on the market of already existing masscommunicational
fields. Agents on the other hand, have none such field. And there is bit
of a technical competiton between them, but also complementary aspects.

<h2>Market determination</h2>

<p class="start">
Mostly, which technology that will survive has to do with the market
and it forces. Microsoft e.g, has an interest in local machines that computes
locally as their operating systems are placed in local computing. Sun e.g,
has an interest in servers and connections as their software and hardware
is dedicated towards terminal-server connections, ultimately. The developments
of both connections as hardware and software in themselves and developments
of local machines give both directions hints of proceeding in the right
direction. Connection improve, more bits per second can travel, in short:
it's getting faster. Machines improve as they can store more, and get more
integrated with the connections, and concluding: they get faster. There
is really nothing today which implies that only one of the developments
should take place. In fact, the most probable thing is that both developments
occur at the same time. Connections have to get smarter and local computing
has to get more enriched, especially as it becomes integrated with the
net. The intelligent agent, the active agent, gives and contains -- as
I see it -- a little of both approaches.

<h2>Agents again and not-the-web-development</h2>

<p class="start">
The intelligent agents that travel give the concept of distribution
yet another application. The agents eliminate the need of direct communication
between client and server, i.e. <I>interactive connections</I>. The task
can be given at one time and the reply returned much later. The server
locally perform the agents wish. The agent can return whenever it is possible,
e.g. when the original client connects again. As I see it, not only has
there to be a standard for communicating with, delivering, executing etc.
agents, but also a new paradigm of beside-the-web-connection-thing. The
web isn't the most suitable, because of its inherent interactive aspect.
There should be a <I>off-line paradigm</I>. The push or pull technologies
cannot offer that. They are both interactive, or at least <I>on-line</I>.
After all, the agents work independently of the originator.
