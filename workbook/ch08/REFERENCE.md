- Cormen, Thomas H., Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. *Introduction to Algorithms*. 3rd ed., MIT Press, 2009.  
  - Often referred to as "CLRS," this is one of the most comprehensive and widely used textbooks
    in computer science. It covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, with detailed explanations,
    pseudocode, and complexity analysis. Itâ€™s aimed at upper-level undergraduates, graduate
    students, and professionals.

- Gamma, Erich, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*. Addison-Wesley, 1994.  
  - Often referred to as the "Gang of Four" (GoF) book, this seminal work introduced the concept
    of design patterns to the software development world. It describes 23 foundational patterns
    for object-oriented design, grouped into creational, structural, and behavioral categories.
    While the examples are in C++ and Smalltalk, the principles are broadly applicable and have
    deeply influenced modern software architecture and best practices.

- Gries, D., & Schneider, F. B. (1993). *A logical approach to discrete math*. Springer.  
  - This book offers a logical and structured approach to discrete mathematics, with a strong
    emphasis on formal proofs and reasoning. Gries and Schneider cover a wide range of topics,
    including sets, functions, relations, induction, combinatorics, and graph theory, providing
    clear explanations and examples. The authors focus on developing the reader's ability to
    reason logically, which is crucial for understanding and solving problems in discrete
    mathematics. This is an excellent resource for students who are new to the subject and
    want to build a solid foundation in both logic and discrete math.

- Lloyd, J.W. *Foundations of Logic Programming*. 2nd extended ed., Springer, 1987.  
  - This foundational text offers a comprehensive exploration of logic programming, emphasizing
    both declarative and procedural semantics. Lloyd delves into topics such as unification,
    resolution, and the fixpoint theory of logic programs. The book provides a rigorous
    mathematical framework for understanding logic programming languages like Prolog, making
    it essential reading for those interested in the theoretical underpinnings of logic-based
    computation.
