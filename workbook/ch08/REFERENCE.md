  - This book offers a logical and structured approach to discrete mathematics, with a strong
    emphasis on formal proofs and reasoning. Gries and Schneider cover a wide range of topics,
    including sets, functions, relations, induction, combinatorics, and graph theory, providing
    clear explanations and examples. The authors focus on developing the reader's ability to
    reason logically, which is crucial for understanding and solving problems in discrete
    mathematics. This is an excellent resource for students who are new to the subject and
    want to build a solid foundation in both logic and discrete math.
