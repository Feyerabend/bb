- Gries, D., & Schneider, F. B. (1993). *A logical approach to discrete math*. Springer.  
  - This book offers a logical and structured approach to discrete mathematics, with a strong
    emphasis on formal proofs and reasoning. Gries and Schneider cover a wide range of topics,
    including sets, functions, relations, induction, combinatorics, and graph theory, providing
    clear explanations and examples. The authors focus on developing the reader's ability to
    reason logically, which is crucial for understanding and solving problems in discrete
    mathematics. This is an excellent resource for students who are new to the subject and
    want to build a solid foundation in both logic and discrete math.

- Lloyd, J.W. *Foundations of Logic Programming*. 2nd extended ed., Springer, 1987.  
  - This foundational text offers a comprehensive exploration of logic programming, emphasizing
    both declarative and procedural semantics. Lloyd delves into topics such as unification,
    resolution, and the fixpoint theory of logic programs. The book provides a rigorous
    mathematical framework for understanding logic programming languages like Prolog, making
    it essential reading for those interested in the theoretical underpinnings of logic-based
    computation.
