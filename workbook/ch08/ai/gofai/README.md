## GOFAI: Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence

Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI) refers to the classical approach to artificial intelligence
that dominated the field from the 1950s through the 1990s. This paradigm fundamentally emphasizes symbolic reasoning,
rule-based systems, and explicit knowledge representation as the primary means to emulate intelligent behavior.
Unlike modern AI, which heavily relies on statistical methods, machine learning, and neural networks to discover
patterns from data, GOFAI focuses on the precise manipulation of predefined symbols and logical rules to solve
problems in a structured, transparent, and largely deterministic manner.

1. *Symbolic Representation*: At its heart, GOFAI operates by encoding knowledge about the world as abstract symbols.
These symbols might represent concrete facts, complex rules, or various states within a problem domain. For example,
in an expert system designed for animal identification, a fact could be "has feathers," while a rule might explicitly
state, "IF 'has feathers' AND 'lays eggs' THEN 'is a bird'." This approach aims to create a computationally tractable
model of human cognition where concepts are clearly defined and interconnected.

2. *Rule-Based Reasoning*: The operational backbone of GOFAI systems rests upon predefined "if-then" rules that are
meticulously crafted and explicitly programmed, often by human domain experts. These rules serve as the mechanism
to derive conclusions, make decisions, or prescribe actions. The system processes these rules sequentially or in
parallel, applying them to the available symbolic knowledge to generate new inferences.

3. *Search and Planning*: GOFAI often employs systematic search algorithms to navigate vast problem spaces. Techniques
such as breadth-first search, A\* search, or backtracking are used to explore potential solutions. This methodical
exploration is fundamental to tasks like finding the optimal path in a maze, solving complex puzzles, or satisfying
a set of intricate constraints within a given domain. Planning systems, a subset of search, construct sequences of
actions to achieve a specific goal.

4. *Logic and Inference*: The foundation of GOFAI's problem-solving capability lies in formal logic and inference
mechanisms. Core techniques include forward chaining, where new facts are systematically derived from existing ones
based on available rules, and backward chaining, which works in reverse by starting from a desired goal and finding
the necessary conditions or facts to achieve it. These logical operations allow GOFAI systems to reason deductively
about their symbolic representations.

5. *Absence of Learning from Data*: A defining characteristic of classical GOFAI systems is their typical inability
to learn directly from raw data in the way modern machine learning systems do. Instead, their intelligence stems from
hand-crafted knowledge bases and algorithms meticulously designed by human experts for specific tasks. Any updates
or improvements to their performance generally require manual modification of their symbolic rules or knowledge
structures.

6. *Transparency*: A significant advantage of GOFAI is its inherent transparency. The decision-making process is
explicit, step-by-step, and fully traceable, allowing human operators to understand *why* a particular conclusion was
reached or a decision was made. This interpretability stands in stark contrast to the often opaque, "black box"
nature of many modern neural networks, where the internal workings leading to an output can be difficult to decipher.

GOFAI is best suited for domains with well-defined rules, clear logical structures, and limited ambiguity, such as
expert systems in niche fields, classic game playing (like chess or checkers), or constraint satisfaction problems.
However, it notably struggles with tasks requiring nuanced perception, dealing with inherent ambiguity, or processing
vast amounts of unstructured, noisy data, areas where modern machine learning approaches demonstrably excel.


### History

The history of Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI) traces back to the early days of AI research,
reflecting the field’s initial optimism about replicating human intelligence through meticulously constructed
symbolic systems. GOFAI, a term coined by philosopher John Haugeland in 1985, represents the classical approach
to AI that dominated the mid-20th century. It emphasised the manipulation of symbols and logic to simulate
intelligent behavior, drawing from the belief that human cognition could be understood as the processing of
symbols according to formal rules.

Despite its limitations, GOFAI laid the foundation for modern AI by introducing key concepts like knowledge
representation, reasoning, and symbolic manipulation. Its influence persists in areas like expert systems,
natural language processing, and automated theorem proving, where structured knowledge and logical inference
remain vital. As a personal reflection in this, GOFAI is for me a natural follow-up in the development of
algorithms.

For a more personal and nuanced view of how AI has evolved, you might explore the different
[seasons](./SEASONS.md) in its history. The account that typically prevails--often called
the “conventional” narrative--is shaped by the victors and tends to overlook ideas and traits
that didn't fit the dominant storyline, as you will notice time and time again:


*1950s–1960s: Foundations of AI*

The very term "artificial intelligence" was coined in 1956 at the seminal Dartmouth Conference, an event
where visionary researchers like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon laid the
intellectual groundwork for the field. They shared a strong conviction that intelligence, particularly
human intelligence, could be fundamentally understood and replicated through the manipulation of symbols.
Early GOFAI systems emerged from this belief, including the *Logic Theorist* (1955) by Newell and Simon,
a program capable of proving mathematical theorems, and McCarthy’s *Lisp* programming language (1958),
specifically designed for efficient symbolic processing. The *General Problem Solver* (GPS) by Newell
and Simon (1957) further exemplified this approach, aiming to mimic human problem-solving by recursively
breaking down complex tasks into manageable goals and subgoals—a hallmark of GOFAI’s search-based methodology.


*1960s–1970s: Expert Systems and Knowledge Engineering*

The 1960s witnessed the nascent rise of expert systems, which represented a significant advancement by
encoding domain-specific knowledge as intricate sets of rules. *DENDRAL* (1965), developed at Stanford,
was a pioneering example, successfully analyzing chemical compounds and demonstrating the potential for
GOFAI to tackle complex real-world problems. Building on this success, the 1970s saw *MYCIN* (Stanford)
become a landmark expert system, capable of diagnosing bacterial infections and recommending treatments
using sophisticated rule-based reasoning, often achieving performance comparable to human medical experts.
During this period, knowledge representation itself became a central research focus, evident in systems
like *SHRDLU* (1970) by Terry Winograd, which could manipulate objects in a virtual "blocks world"
environment and engage in natural language understanding.


*1980s: AI Boom and Commercialisation*

The 1980s marked the commercial peak of GOFAI, driven by widespread enthusiasm and the successful deployment
of expert systems in industrial applications. Companies like Symbolics emerged, developing specialised Lisp
machines to provide dedicated hardware for AI applications. Prominent systems like *XCON* (1980) by
Digital Equipment Corporation, which automated the complex configuration of computer systems, reportedly
saved the company millions annually. However, despite these successes, GOFAI faced mounting challenges
 These systems were often "brittle," meaning they performed well within their narrow, defined domains but
 struggled significantly with tasks outside those boundaries. They also required extensive, costly, and
 laborious manual "knowledge engineering" to build and maintain their rule bases, and crucially, they
 struggled to incorporate common-sense reasoning, which proved far more complex than initially anticipated.


*Late 1980s–1990s: AI Winter and Shift to Machine Learning*

By the late 1980s, the inherent limitations and the high costs associated with GOFAI, coupled with its
failure to achieve broader, general intelligence, led to widespread disillusionment. This period triggered
the "AI Winter," characterized by significantly reduced funding and diminished public and academic interest
in AI research. Concurrently, the 1990s saw a pivotal shift in AI research, driven by the emergence of
statistical methods and artificial neural networks. This new wave of data-driven approaches was bolstered
by exponential increases in computational power and, critically, the growing availability of large datasets.
While systems like IBM’s *Deep Blue* (1997), which famously defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov, still
incorporated classic GOFAI techniques such as extensive search and heuristics, its success also highlighted
a growing reliance on brute-force computation and hinted at the power of learning from data. The overall
research focus irrevocably shifted away from purely symbolic GOFAI towards data-driven AI. Although its
dominance waned, GOFAI’s influence persisted in specialized areas like automated planning, logic programming,
and constraint satisfaction.


*2000s–Present: Legacy and Revival*

While contemporary AI is predominantly dominated by machine learning paradigms, the foundational ideas and
principles of GOFAI remain profoundly relevant, particularly in domains demanding transparency, explainability,
and rigorous logical inference. This includes areas such as legal reasoning, automated theorem proving, and
critical aspects of robotics planning. Increasingly, there is a renewed interest in *hybrid systems* that
judiciously combine GOFAI’s strengths in symbolic reasoning and explicit knowledge representation with the
pattern recognition and learning capabilities of modern machine learning. Such hybrid approaches are seen
as promising avenues for developing more robust and explainable AI, especially for complex tasks requiring
both logical deduction and perceptual understanding. GOFAI’s enduring legacy is evident in ongoing projects
like *Cyc* (in development since 1984), which strives to build a comprehensive, human-level common-sense
knowledge base, and in the advanced planning and scheduling algorithms routinely employed in modern logistics,
supply chain management, and autonomous systems.
