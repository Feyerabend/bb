GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI) 8-Puzzle Solver
Demonstrates classic AI search algorithms

Key GOFAI Concepts Demonstrated:
1. State space search
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) - guarantees optimal solution
3. Depth-First Search (DFS) - explores deeply first
4. A* Search with heuristics - informed search
5. Problem representation as states and operators
6. Systematic exploration without learning
