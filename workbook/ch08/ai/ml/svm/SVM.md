## Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning algorithms, primarily
used for classification and regression tasks. Developed by Vladimir Vapnik and his
colleagues in the 1990s, SVMs became one of the most popular machine learning methods
due to their strong theoretical foundations and excellent performance on many real-world
problems. However, interest in SVMs has declined in recent years.
