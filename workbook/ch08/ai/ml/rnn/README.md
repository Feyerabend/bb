## Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Machine learning empowers systems to learn from data and improve performance over
time without explicit programming, and a specialised type of neural network, the
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), is particularly adept at handling sequential data,
making it a cornerstone for tasks like natural language processing and time series
analysis.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks designed
to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, speech, or time series.
Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that loop back
on themselves, allowing information from previous steps in a sequence to be retained
and used in the current step through a "hidden state." This recurrent connection
enables RNNs to maintain an internal memory of the sequence, making them suitable
for tasks where context is important, such as language modeling where the prediction
of the next word depends on the preceding words.

The provided `rnn_sample.py` and `shakespeare_naive.py` code offers a foundational
implementation of a Simple Recurrent Neural Network. The `SimpleRNN` class in
`rnn_sample.py` establishes the core components of an RNN, including the initialisation
of weights and biases, the use of `tanh` as an activation function for the hidden layer,
and `softmax` for the output layer to produce probability distributions over the
vocabulary. It also details the forward pass, where inputs are processed sequentially
and hidden states are updated, and the backward pass, which involves backpropagation
through time to calculate and apply gradients for weight updates, thereby enabling
the network to learn from its errors. The `shakespeare_naive.py` expands on this by
adding gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients, a common issue in RNN training,
and introduces a `ShakespeareDataLoader` to manage text files, allowing for training
on larger datasets of Shakespearean works. This implementation demonstrates the
fundamental principles of RNNs, specifically for character-level language modeling,
where the network learns to predict the next character in a sequence based on the
preceding ones.


Expanding on the foundational RNN implementation, `shakespeare_opt.py` introduces
significant optimizations for training stability and efficiency. It incorporates
RMSprop, an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm, which adjusts the learning
rate for each weight individually, leading to faster convergence and better performance
compared to vanilla stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, it employs a decay
rate for the learning rate, gradually reducing it over epochs to fine-tune the model's
weights and prevent overshooting the optimal solution. The inclusion of a smooth loss
calculation helps to provide a more stable and readable indication of training progress
by averaging the loss over recent iterations. The `shakespeare_gpu.py` code further
enhances performance by integrating GPU acceleration through the `cupy` library,
replacing standard Python lists and `math` operations with `cupy.ndarray` and
`cupy.cuda.Device` for matrix operations and computations. This leverages the parallel
processing capabilities of GPUs, drastically speeding up both the forward and backward
passes. Memory management is also addressed by explicitly clearing GPU memory at the
end of training steps. Finally, `shakespeare_tensor.py` brings a more robust and flexible
matrix and vector computation by introducing a custom `Tensor` class. This class overloads
arithmetic operators, enabling more intuitive and readable matrix manipulations. It also
incorporates an `AdamOptimizer` for weight updates, a more advanced adaptive learning
rate optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of RMSprop and Adagrad, often
leading to even faster and more stable training. These advancements collectively demonstrate
a progression from a basic RNN implementation to more sophisticated and performant models
through optimization techniques, GPU acceleration, and improved numerical computation
structures.
