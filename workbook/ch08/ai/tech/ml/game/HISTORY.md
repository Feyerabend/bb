## Short History of Game Theory 

Game theory originated as a mathematical approach to analysing situations of strategic
interaction--cases where the outcome for each participant depends not only on their own
choices, but also on the choices of others. Its roots go back to the 18th and 19th centuries,
but it became a formal discipline in the 20th.

The first known mathematical treatment of strategic games is found in the work of James
Waldegrave (1713), who analysed a mixed-strategy solution to a two-person card game. Later,
figures like Antoine Augustin Cournot (1838) studied duopoly models, and Francis Ysidro
Edgeworth and Émile Borel touched on concepts related to strategy and utility, laying
early groundwork.

However, game theory as a unified field truly began with John von Neumann. In 1928, he
proved the minimax theorem for zero-sum two-player games, showing that each player has
an optimal mixed strategy that minimises their maximum possible loss. This result was
foundational.

The major milestone came in 1944 with the publication of *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior*
by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern. This book introduced formal definitions,
utility theory, and the idea of cooperative and non-cooperative games, aiming to provide
a foundation for economics based on rational strategic interaction.

In the 1950s, John Nash expanded the scope of game theory by introducing what is now
called the Nash equilibrium--a key concept for analysing non-zero-sum games where each
player’s strategy is optimal given the strategies of others. His work extended the reach
of game theory beyond strict competition, enabling applications to negotiation, coordination,
and conflict.

During the Cold War, game theory became influential in political science and military
strategy, especially in nuclear deterrence theory (e.g. through the work of Thomas Schelling).
Meanwhile, economists applied it to oligopoly theory, auction design, and bargaining.

From the 1970s onward, game theory matured and diversified. Refinements such as subgame
perfect equilibrium, evolutionary game theory, and repeated games expanded the theory's
scope. Game theory became essential in microeconomics, political science, biology, but also in
computer science. In 1994, Nash, Reinhard Selten, and John Harsanyi were awarded the Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their contributions.

In the 21st century, game theory continues to evolve--integrating behavioural findings,
algorithmic complexity, and real-world applications like market design (e.g., spectrum
auctions), social networks, and mechanism design. Today, it is a central tool in both
theoretical and applied fields concerned with rational decision-making in multi-agent
environments.
