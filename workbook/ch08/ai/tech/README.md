## The Technology of AI/ML

Artificial Intelligence, as both a scientific field and a cultural phenomenon, is far from a
unified endeavor. It is a patchwork of approaches, histories, and shifting priorities, marked
by competing visions of what it means for a machine to "act intelligently." In this collection,
we trace three distinct yet interconnected paths within AI: the symbolic tradition of
[GOFAI](./gofai/) (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), the modern algorithmic boom of
[machine learning](./ml/), and an example of a more philosophical or conceptual strand anchored
by the work of David E. Stanley and others interested in [discovery](./discovery/) and the
nature of intelligent behavior.

GOFAI represents the early promise that intelligence could be engineered through formal logic,
planning systems, and neatly packaged rules. Rooted in cognitive science and early computer
science, this tradition aspired to model human reasoning in explicit, inspectable structures.
Though now often overshadowed by data-driven techniques, GOFAI remains foundational--its legacy
persists in knowledge representation, planning, and the pursuit of explainable AI.

By contrast, the contemporary field of machine learning, particularly its statistical and neural
approaches, has reshaped AI into a discipline less concerned with internal reasoning and more
with external performance. Here, systems learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed.
The emphasis shifts from knowing to fitting, from designed structure to emergent behavior.
The second part of this material surveys a variety of learning algorithms, each with its own
trade-offs and assumptions about the nature of generalization.

Finally, the section on discovery returns us to a more reflective stance. Drawing on ideas from
philosophy of science and cognitive development, it asks how novelty and structure arise--not
only in artificial agents but also in our understanding of intelligence itself. In the spirit
of Stanley and others, this material resists premature closure and invites a broader conversation
about what AI can be, beyond performance benchmarks or narrow definitions.

*This triptych of themes is not meant to be exhaustive. It is a map drawn from one perspective,
and you are encouraged to redraw it as you read, challenge, and explore. AI, after all, is not
only about building machines that learn or reason, but also about how we choose to describe,
formalise, and imagine intelligence in the first place.*
