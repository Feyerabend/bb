| Concept      | Transversal            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| *Noise*      | Affects communication, sensing, and even logic gates  |
| *Randomness*   | Critical in simulation, cryptography, testing, protocols |
| *Optimisation*  | Present in compilers, algorithms, hardware, energy use |
| *Security*    | Requires attention at every layer: physical to logical |
| *Interface*    | Defines component interaction everywhere        |
| *Abstraction*   | Central to all software and hardware design      |
| *Scalability*   | Applies to data, computation, architecture       |
| *Latency*     | Matters in networks, UI, hardware timing        |
| *Concurrency*   | Appears from CPU pipelines to distributed systems   |
| *Fault tolerance* | From ECC memory to retry loops in software       |
| *Determinism*   | Affects debugging, simulation, and predictability   |
| *Time*      | Scheduling, clocks, profiling, causality in distributed systems |
| *Complexity*   | Measured algorithmically, but also felt in UX and architecture |
| *State*      | Core to both computing and modeling; managed differently across layers |
| *Energy use*   | Crucial from battery devices to datacenters      |
| *Cost*      | Not just economic, but computational, spatial, or temporal |
| *Errors*   | Arise from hardware faults, logic bugs, bad input, or user misunderstanding |
