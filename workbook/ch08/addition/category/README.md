## The Missing Section: Category Theory

Not everything that belongs in a book can ultimately be included. Constraints of time, scope, and sheer physical size impose their own structure, often more decisively than intention alone. At 756 pages, this book has already grown well beyond its original outline, and some material--however important--had to be left aside.

Category theory is one such omission.

This is not because it lacks relevance. On the contrary, category theory has become one of the central unifying frameworks of modern theory, influencing mathematics, logic, computer science, and related fields. Its absence here should therefore not be read as a judgment of importance, but as a consequence of scale.

To introduce category theory in a meaningful way would require more than a brief appendix or a cursory overview. It would demand additional space, careful preparation, and in many places a restructuring of earlier material to do it justice. Given the already considerable length of the book, that expansion was not feasible within the present project.
For that reason, the topic has been deferred rather than dismissed.

If a revised or expanded edition is ever undertaken, category theory would be a natural candidate for inclusion, possibly as a substantial new section or even as a parallel volume. Until then, the reader should be aware that many ideas developed here admit a categorical interpretation, even if that language is not explicitly employed.

And so on ..
