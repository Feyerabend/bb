## State

At its most basic, *state refers to the current condition or configuration of a system or component
at a particular point in time.* It encompasses all the data, values, and settings that describe the
system's instantaneous status. Think of it as a snapshot. Without state, a system is static and inert;
with it, it can react, evolve, and perform computations.


### Core

State is absolutely central to computing, and you can see its manifestation in several key areas. Memory
is perhaps the most direct example, with RAM, registers, and caches all holding data that represents the
current state of ongoing computations. In programming, variables serve as explicit containers for state;
their values shift as a program runs, reflecting the changing state of the computation. The program counter
is another crucial piece of internal state, a register that holds the memory address of the next instruction
for the CPU to execute, ensuring the system knows where it is in a program. Finally, input/output buffers
hold data waiting to be processed or sent, representing the state of communication channels within the computer.

### Modelling

State is equally fundamental to modeling, evident in various applications. In a simulation, the system's
state is dynamically updated at each time step, driven by predefined rules and interactions; a weather model,
for instance, encompasses temperature, pressure, and humidity at various points as its state. Finite State
Machines (FSMs) offer a robust modeling paradigm where a system is characterized by a finite set of states 
and transitions between them, activated by specific events, finding utility in diverse areas from user
interfaces to network protocols. Lastly, System Dynamics models depict the stocks—which represent accumulations
of resources and thus state—and the flows, or rates of change, within a system.


#### Hardware Layer: Physical State

The beauty and complexity of state lie in how it's managed, represented, and abstracted at different
layers of a computer system.

* *Transistor States:* At the lowest level, state is represented by the on/off (high/low voltage) state
  of individual transistors, which collectively form bits.

* *Flip-Flops & Latches:* These are basic memory elements that can hold a single bit of state. They are
  the building blocks of registers and cache memory.

* *Registers:* Small, fast storage locations within the CPU that hold data actively being processed
  (e.g., accumulator, instruction register, program counter). Their contents represent the CPU's immediate
  operational state.

* *Memory Cells:* Physical locations in RAM holding multiple bits. The charge (or lack thereof) in a
  capacitor, for example, represents a bit's state.

* *Management:* Directly controlled by electrical signals and clock cycles. Synchronization is crucial
  to avoid race conditions.


#### Operating System Layer: System State

* *Process State:* Each running program (process) has a state: running, ready, waiting, terminated. This
  includes its program counter, registers, memory allocated, open files.

* *File System State:* The current structure of directories and files, their permissions, and their content.

* *Device State:* The current operational status of connected hardware devices (e.g., printer is busy,
  network card is connected).

* *System Configuration:* Settings, environment variables, network configurations--all constitute the overall
  system state.

* *Management:* The OS manages and protects process states, schedules their execution, handles memory
  allocation, and orchestrates device interactions. Context switching involves saving and restoring
  the state of processes.


#### Application Layer: Programmatic & User State

* *Variables and Data Structures:* Within a program, the values of variables, the contents of arrays, objects,
  and other data structures represent the application's state.

* *User Interface State:* The current values in text fields, the selected items in lists, the checked status
  of checkboxes, the visibility of elements--all define the UI's state.

* *Application Data:* The specific information being processed by the application (e.g., the contents of a
  document in a word processor, the items in a shopping cart).

* *Session State:* In web applications, this refers to data associated with a user's current interaction
  session (e.g., login status, preferences, temporary data).

* *Management:* Handled by programming language constructs (variables, objects), frameworks (e.g., React's
  state management), and architectural patterns (e.g., Redux).


#### Network/Distributed Systems Layer: Distributed State

* *Server State:* The operational state of a server (e.g., running, overloaded, number of connections).

* *Database State:* The entire collection of data stored in a database, which must be consistent and durable.

* *Distributed Consensus:* In distributed systems, achieving agreement on a shared state across multiple nodes
  is a major challenge (e.g., Paxos, Raft algorithms).

* *Cache State:* Data stored in distributed caches to speed up access, often with consistency challenges.

* *Management:* Requires complex protocols for synchronization, replication, fault tolerance, and consistency
  (e.g., ACID properties for databases, eventual consistency).


### Illustrations and Context

* *Traffic Light:* A classic FSM. Its states are RED, YELLOW, GREEN. Events (timers) trigger transitions between
  these states. The current color is its state.

* *Video Game:* The state of a game includes the player's position, health, inventory, the positions of enemies,
  the score, the current level. Every frame updates this state.

* *Web Browser:* The state includes the current URL, Browse history, open tabs, form data entered, cookies
  (local state).

* *Version Control System (Git):* The "state" is the entire codebase at a specific commit. Each commit represents
  a snapshot of the repository's state at a point in time. Branches and merges involve managing transitions and
  divergences of this state.

More on concepts of states can be read in a low-level approach of [state machines](./../../../ch07/mech/state/),
as well as the [state pattern](./../../../ch07/patterns/state/).



#### State and Programming Paradigms

* *Imperative Programming:* Heavily relies on mutable state. Programs are sequences of commands that change the
  program's state step by step. (e.g., C, Java, Python). (Cf. [imperative languages](./../../../ch07/models/imp/).)

* *Functional Programming:* Emphasises immutable state and pure functions (functions with no side effects). State
  changes are often modeled by producing new versions of data rather than modifying existing ones. This aims for
  greater predictability and easier parallelization. (e.g., Haskell, Lisp, parts of JavaScript).
  (Cf. [functional languages](./../../../ch07/models/fp/).)

* *Object-Oriented Programming:* Objects encapsulate both data (state) and behavior (methods). State is often
  managed internally within objects. (Cf. [object-oriented languages](./../../../ch07/models/oo/).)


#### State in Distributed Systems

* *Stateless vs. Stateful Services:* A stateless service doesn't store any client-specific data between requests,
  making it easier to scale. A stateful service maintains client-specific state, often requiring more complex
  solutions for scaling and fault tolerance.

* *Consistency Models:* In distributed databases, different consistency models (e.g., strong consistency, eventual
  consistency) define how quickly state changes are propagated and seen by different nodes.

* *Distributed Transactions:* Ensuring that a series of operations across multiple nodes either all succeed or all
  fail, maintaining the consistency of distributed state.


#### State in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

* *User Interface State Management:* Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular provide mechanisms for managing the
  dynamic state of a UI, ensuring that changes to data are reflected in the displayed interface.

* *Undo/Redo Functionality:* Requires tracking the historical states of an application, allowing users to revert
  or reapply changes.

* *Accessibility:* The state of assistive technologies and user preferences that influence how an application
  is presented and interacted with.


#### The Problem of "State Sprawl" and Management Complexity

As systems grow, managing state can become incredibly complex.

* *Debugging:* Understanding why a system is in a particular, incorrect state can be very difficult,
  especially with many interacting components.

* *Testing:* Testing all possible state transitions and combinations is often impractical.

* *Concurrency Issues:* Race conditions, deadlocks, and livelocks are common problems arising from
  uncontrolled access to shared mutable state.

* *Scalability:* Distributing and synchronizing state across multiple machines is a fundamental
  challenge in scalable systems.


### Conclusion

The concept of "state" is arguably one of the most pervasive and critical element in understanding how
computers work, how software is built, and how systems evolve over time. From the flickering voltages
of a transistor to the complex internal workings of a global distributed system, state is the
information that defines "what is now." Its management, whether through careful hardware design,
robust operating systems, elegant programming paradigms, or sophisticated distributed algorithms,
remains a central challenge and a key area of innovation in computing.
