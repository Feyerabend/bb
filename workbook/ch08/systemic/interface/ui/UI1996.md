### Going back ..

Over the years, I've reflected on the development of user interfaces, especially
from the 1980s up to the present. One recurring idea that keeps resurfacing for
me is how appealing and foundational the terminal-based interaction still feels.
There's a certain clarity and minimalism in the command-line model that I find
deeply grounding, particularly in contrast to many of the trends that have followed.

Interestingly, I also appreciate the recent return to text-based interaction in
the form of AI chat interfaces. These systems, despite their underlying complexity,
offer a calm and conversational mode of communication that feels surprisingly close
to the terminal modelâ€”structured, sequential, yet responsive. It's a mode that
doesn't overwhelm you visually, and that, to me, is a relief.

That said, my own history includes the opposite trajectory. Back in the early 1980s,
I was part of the push to bring the Macintosh-style graphical windowing experience--introduced
in 1984--onto 8-bit systems like the Swedish ABC80 from 1978. The computer was a
close approximate to the TRS-80, Apple II or Commodore Pet, all from 1977. At the time,
this felt like real progress: a leap forward in accessibility, visual clarity, and
interaction. There was a sense of elegance and ambition in designing for visual
environments with constrained resources.

But over time, I've become increasingly critical of where GUI design has led us. What
began as an effort to make systems more intuitive has often resulted in clutter and
distraction. Today's interfaces frequently suffer from overcrowded windows, constant
notifications, and user flows that complicate what should be simple tasks--like
moving or copying files. Yes, in one sense, things are "easier" than they were:
fewer commands to memorise, more drag-and-drop, more wizards. But in another sense,
something has stalled, or even regressed. Systems have become bloated, less predictable,
and often impose modes of interaction that feel opaque or overly abstracted from
the underlying tasks.

I think this tension is worth dwelling on. There was a moment in interface history
where simplicity and power coexisted--where knowing a few commands gave you a high
degree of control without noise. Now we often trade that control for what appears
to be convenience, but what can feel more like fragmentation and friction.


### Thoughts from 1996 (ui1996)

This trilogy of essays, written around the mid-1990s, offers a critical and speculative exploration of graphical user
interface design at a time when computing was transitioning from standalone machines to networked environments. While
framed in the context of Sun Microsystems' HotJava Views and the emerging Network Computer concept, the texts reflect
some deeper concerns about complexity, user autonomy, and the nature of interface metaphors.

Despite their age, these writings remain relevant conceptually. The critique of bloated software, unnecessary features,
and the decline in usability resonates with today's minimalist design philosophies and the renewed focus on simplicity
in application interfaces. My taxonomy of control modalities--keyboard commands, alphanumeric instructions, menus,
dialogs, and symbolic interfaces--remains somewhat pedagogically useful and closely mirrors modern classifications in
human-computer interaction. My then dissatisfaction with the "desktop metaphor" and preference for more abstract or
task-centered interface models might foreshadow the move away from skeuomorphic designs and the rise of flat,
user-intent-driven interfaces.

Technologically, some hopes and focal points--such as the success of HotJava Views, or the idea of mobile code agents
executing independently across machines--did not materialise, I can not guess all of the future. These concepts have
been replaced or reimagined in terms of cloud services, containerisation, and asynchronous communication protocols.
However, the call for simplification and specificity in software--tools built for tasks rather than generality--has
been validated by later trends in focused productivity apps and purpose-built UI shells.

What stands out most is this proposal for an object-oriented GUI, not in terms of programming paradigms but as a
user-facing model where objects and contextually adaptive command tables define interaction. This idea, though here
presented in speculative language, anticipates modern reactive interfaces and design systems that adapt behavior based
on user context and intent. The notion of "picture commands," where graphical elements serve both as display and
interaction mechanisms, also anticipates some current work in visual programming, page previews, and context-aware visual
editing environments.

The essays are written in a personal, often reflective style, blending technical observation with anecdote and philosophical
questioning. While the language is occasionally dated and the HTML presentation primitive (yes, we didn't have much to choose
from then), the intellectual core of the texts offers, or might offer, enduring insights. They can be valuable as historical
documents showing how critical thinkers outside mainstream commercial design circles anticipated both the problems and
some of the solutions that continue to define interface design today.

In short, these writings are apparently not technically up-to-date, but they could be said to remain conceptually fresh.
Their value lies in how they ask fundamental questions about the relationship between user and system, the purpose of design,
and the trade-offs between power and simplicity--questions that remain unresolved and deeply relevant.
