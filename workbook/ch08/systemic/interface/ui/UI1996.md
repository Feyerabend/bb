### Going back ..

Over the years, I’ve reflected on the development of user interfaces, especially from the 1980s up to the present.
One recurring idea that keeps resurfacing for me is how appealing and foundational the terminal-based interaction
still feels. There’s a certain clarity and minimalism in the command-line model that I find deeply grounding,
particularly in contrast to many of the trends that have followed.

Interestingly, I also appreciate the recent return to text-based interaction in the form of AI chat interfaces.
These systems, despite their underlying complexity, offer a calm and conversational mode of communication that
feels surprisingly close to the terminal model—structured, sequential, yet responsive. It’s a mode that doesn’t
overwhelm you visually, and that, to me, is a relief.

That said, my own history includes the opposite trajectory. Back in the early 1980s, I was part of the push to
bring the Macintosh-style graphical windowing experience--introduced in 1984--onto 8-bit systems like the Swedish
ABC80 from 1978. The computer was a close approximate to the TRS-80, Apple II or Commodore Pet, all from 1977.
At the time, this felt like real progress: a leap forward in accessibility, visual clarity, and interaction.
There was a sense of elegance and ambition in designing for visual environments with constrained resources.

But over time, I’ve become increasingly critical of where GUI design has led us. What began as an effort to make
systems more intuitive has often resulted in clutter and distraction. Today’s interfaces frequently suffer from 
vercrowded windows, constant notifications, and user flows that complicate what should be simple tasks--like
moving or copying files. Yes, in one sense, things are "easier" than they were: fewer commands to memorise,
more drag-and-drop, more wizards. But in another sense, something has stalled, or even regressed. Systems have
become bloated, less predictable, and often impose modes of interaction that feel opaque or overly abstracted
from the underlying tasks.

I think this tension is worth dwelling on. There was a moment in interface history where simplicity and power
coexisted--where knowing a few commands gave you a high degree of control without noise. Now we often trade that
control for what appears to be convenience, but what can feel more like fragmentation and friction.


### Thoughts from 1996 (ui1996)

The ideas from "Towards a New Design of Graphical Interfaces" reflects a critique of the prevailing complexity
of graphical user interfaces and proposes alternative principles for their future development. The first part
begins with a reflection on how computer interfaces evolved from text-based systems to increasingly graphical
ones, with control methods spanning from keyboard commands to symbolic icons and pictures. Here we categorise
interface control into three broad types: hardware-based keyboard commands, alphanumerical inputs (like typed
commands and dialogs), and symbolic or pictorial controls (icons, toolbars). I then argued that while graphical
interfaces improved accessibility and discoverability for novices, they also introduced clutter and inefficiencies,
with menus and icons eventually becoming as overloaded and cryptic as earlier keyboard controls.

In the second part, I contrast this bloated interface tradition with the simpler and more purpose-specific approach
embodied by Sun Microsystems’ "HotJava Views," an interface designed for Network Computers (NCs) using Java.
HotJava Views, aimed at transaction workers, strips away common interface elements like menus, file systems,
and overlapping windows in favor of single-purpose screens, simplified visuals, and minimal interaction models.
I then praise this as a potential return to purposeful, clear interface design, informed by older paradigms like
terminals. Instead of competing with features, HotJava focuses on clarity and job-specific utility. There are some
concerns about centralisation and user autonomy, that the NC model revives the mainframe-terminal structure of
the 1970s, but also there is a potential advantage if managed well.

In the third part, I propose extending the ideas of HotJava Views into a more generalised and object-oriented
graphical interface model. A conceptual design where the interface is built from “spaces” containing objects,
and methods are applied via context-sensitive command tables—graphical hybrids of menus and dialogs. In this
model, the traditional desktop metaphor and file system are eliminated, and interaction becomes more dynamic
and modular. Commands could be given through graphical icons or textual prompts, tailored to individual user
profiles or conventions. The system remains visual but grounded in coherent design logic rather than inherited
physical metaphors. This I thought was a way to resolve the tension between user autonomy, interface clarity,
and system complexity, drawing inspiration from object-oriented programming and early interface experiments while
rejecting the excesses of mainstream desktop environments.

What stands out most is this proposal for an object-oriented GUI, not in terms of programming paradigms but as a
user-facing model where objects and contextually adaptive command tables define interaction. This idea, though here
presented in speculative language, anticipates modern reactive interfaces and design systems that adapt behavior based
on user context and intent. The notion of "picture commands," where graphical elements serve both as display and
interaction mechanisms, also anticipates some current work in visual programming, page previews, and context-aware visual
editing environments. But then, other ideas are not reflected in the current development.

The essays are written in a personal, often reflective style, blending technical observation with anecdote and philosophical
questioning. While the language is occasionally dated and the HTML presentation primitive (yes, we didn't have much to choose
from then), the intellectual core of the texts offers, or might offer, enduring insights. They can be valuable as historical
documents showing how critical thinkers outside mainstream commercial design circles anticipated both the problems and
some of the solutions that continue to define interface design today.

In short, these writings are apparently not technically up-to-date, but they could be said to remain conceptually fresh.
Their value lies in how they ask fundamental questions about the relationship between user and system, the purpose of design,
and the trade-offs between power and simplicity--questions that remain unresolved and deeply relevant.

Hopefully they serve as a point for departure for disussions?
