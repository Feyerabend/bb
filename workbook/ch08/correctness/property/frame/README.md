## Property-Based Testing Framework

This codebase provides a property-based testing framework, designed to facilitate the creation,
execution, and analysis of property-based tests. Property-based testing helps uncover edge cases
and unexpected behaviours by generating diverse test inputs systematically.

We have two main components:

1. *Strategies (strategies.py)*: A collection of classes and functions for generating and
   shrinking test inputs. Strategies define how to create random inputs of various types
   (e.g., integers, strings, lists) and how to simplify failing cases to identify minimal
   counterexamples.

2. *Testing Framework (framework.py)*: A comprehensive system for executing property-based
   tests, handling test failures, and performing input shrinking to produce minimal failing
   cases. It includes utilities for test configuration, result reporting, and integration
   with Python's testing workflow.


### Features

- *Flexible Input Generation*: The framework supports a variety of data types through
  customisable strategies, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries,
  and more. Strategies can be combined, mapped, or filtered to create complex input distributions.

- *Automatic Shrinking*: When a test fails, the framework automatically attempts to simplify
  the failing input to find the smallest possible case that still triggers the failure,
  making debugging easier.

- *Configurable Testing*: Users can specify parameters such as the number of test cases, random
  seed for reproducibility, and maximum shrinking time. The framework supports verbose output
  for detailed test progress.

- *Decorator and Context Manager Support*: The framework provides a `@given` decorator for
  seamless integration with test functions and a `PropertyTestSettings` context manager for
  configuring test settings.

- *Comprehensive Results*: Test results include detailed information such as whether the test
  passed, the number of examples tried, execution time, minimal failing case (if applicable),
  and complexity reduction metrics.


### How It Works

1. *Define a Property*: A property is a function that takes one or more inputs and returns
   `True` if the property holds, or raises an exception/returns `False` if it fails. For
   example, a property might assert that reversing a list twice returns the original list.

2. *Choose a Strategy*: Select or create a strategy to generate test inputs. For instance,
   `lists(integers(-10, 10))` generates lists of integers between -10 and 10.

3. *Run the Test*: Use the `test_property` function or the `@given` decorator to execute
   the test. The framework generates inputs, tests the property, and shrinks any failing
   cases.

4. *Analyse Results*: The framework returns a `TestResult` object with detailed information
   about the test execution, including any failures and minimal counterexamples.



```python
from framework import given, integers

@given(integers(0, 100))
def test_square_root_positive(x):
    import math
    return math.sqrt(x) >= 0

result = test_square_root_positive(verbose=True)
print(f"Test {'passed' if result.passed else 'failed'}")
```

This example tests whether the square root of non-negative integers is non-negative,
using the `integers` strategy to generate inputs between 0 and 100.


### Comments on Code

- *Robustness*: By testing properties over many inputs, the framework helps
  ensure code correctness across diverse scenarios.

- *Debugging Aid*: Automatic shrinking simplifies failing cases, making it
  easier to identify the root cause of issues.

- *Flexibility*: The modular strategy system allows users to define custom
  input generators tailored to their needs.

- *Reproducibility*: Random seeds ensure consistent test results, aiding
  in debugging and regression testing.



- *Modularity*: The separation of concerns between `strategies.py` (input
  generation) and `framework.py` (test execution) makes the codebase maintainable
  and extensible. New strategies can be added without modifying the testing framework.

- *Robust Error Handling*: The framework gracefully handles exceptions during
  property execution and shrinking, providing detailed tracebacks and minimal
  failing cases.

- *Shrinking Efficiency*: The greedy shrinking approach (taking the first improvement
  found) is effective but could be enhanced with more sophisticated strategies, such
  as trying multiple candidates in parallel to find the absolute minimal case.

- *Complexity Estimation*: The `_estimate_complexity` function provides a reasonable
  heuristic for measuring input complexity, but it could be improved for specific
  types (e.g., considering string content or dictionary key-value relationships).

- *Verbose Output*: The verbose mode is helpful for debugging, but the output could
  be formatted more clearly, perhaps with structured logging or customisable reporting.

- *Potential Improvements*:
  - Add support for parallel test execution to improve performance for large test suites.
  - Enhance shrinking for `MappedStrategy` to handle transformations more effectively.
  - Introduce coverage tracking to provide insights into which code paths are exercised
    by generated inputs.
  - Add more advanced strategy combinators, such as recursive strategies for generating
    nested data structures.

Overall, the framework is well-designed for property-based testing, offering a solid
foundation for testing complex properties while remaining user-friendly and extensible.
