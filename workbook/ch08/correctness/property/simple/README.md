## Two Programs


#### Basic Unit Tests for Sorting Function, Program 1

- *Purpose*: This program tests a sorting function (`sort`) using a series of
  unit tests to verify its correctness.
- *Description*: The `test_sort` function contains assertions to check the `sort`
  function's behavior on specific cases:
  - Basic sorting (e.g., `[3, 1, 2]` â†’ `[1, 2, 3]`).
  - Edge cases (empty list `[]` and single-element list `[5]`).
  - Lists with duplicates (`[1, 1, 1]`).
  - Lists with negative numbers (`[-1, 0, 1]`).
- *Sort Function*: The `sort` function is a simple wrapper around Python's
  built-in `sorted` function, returning a sorted copy of the input list.
- *Testing Approach*: Uses hardcoded test cases to validate specific scenarios.


#### Property-Based Testing for Sorting Function, Program 2

- *Purpose*: This program tests the `sort` function using property-based testing
  to verify general properties of sorting.
- *Description*: The `test_sort_properties` function uses the Hypothesis library
  to generate random lists of integers and test four properties:
  - *Ordering invariant*: Each element in the sorted list is less than or equal
    to its successor.
  - *Permutation property*: The sorted list contains the same elements as the
    input (same frequency, different order).
  - *Length preservation*: The sorted list has the same length as the input.
  - *Idempotence*: Sorting an already sorted list yields the same list.
- *Sort Function*: Identical to Program 1, using Python's `sorted` function.
- *Testing Approach*: Uses Hypothesis to generate random inputs, testing general
  properties rather than specific cases.


### Differences Between the Programs

1. *Testing Methodology*:
   - *Program 1*: Uses unit testing with manually defined test cases to check
     specific inputs and expected outputs.
   - *Program 2*: Uses property-based testing with Hypothesis to test general
     properties of the sorting function across randomly generated inputs.

2. *Scope of Testing*:
   - *Program 1*: Focuses on specific scenarios (e.g., empty lists, duplicates,
     negative numbers).
   - *Program 2*: Tests universal properties that any correct sorting function
     should satisfy, applicable to a wide range of inputs.

3. *Input Generation*:
   - *Program 1*: Inputs are hardcoded and limited to a few cases.
   - *Program 2*: Inputs are dynamically generated by Hypothesis, covering a broad range of integer lists (including edge cases).

4. *Assertions*:
   - *Program 1*: Asserts exact output matches for specific inputs (e.g., 
     `sort([3, 1, 2]) == [1, 2, 3]`).
   - *Program 2*: Asserts general properties (e.g., ordering, permutation,
     length, idempotence) rather than specific outputs.

5. *Dependencies*:
   - *Program 1*: No external libraries required; uses Python's standard library.
   - *Program 2*: Requires the Hypothesis library for property-based testing.

### Commonalities Between the Programs

1. *Sort Function*:
   - Both programs use the same `sort` function, which is a simple wrapper
     around Python's `sorted` function, returning a sorted copy of the input list.

2. *Purpose*:
   - Both aim to verify the correctness of the `sort` function, ensuring it
     produces valid sorted outputs.

3. *Testing Focus*:
   - Both test the sorting behavior, including handling of edge cases (e.g.,
     empty lists) and general correctness.

4. *Assertion-Based Validation*:
   - Both use assertions to check whether the `sort` function behaves as expected,
     raising errors if tests fail.

5. *Python-Based*:
   - Both are written in Python and rely on Python's built-in `sorted` function
     for the actual sorting logic.


### Summary

- *Program trad_sort.py* is a straightforward unit-testing approach with specific,
  predefined test cases, suitable for verifying known scenarios.

- *Program hyp_sort.py* uses property-based testing to ensure the sorting function
  adheres to general principles across a wide range of inputs, offering broader
  coverage but requiring the Hypothesis library.

- *Common Ground*: Both test the same `sort` function for correctness, but they
  differ in their approach (specific vs. general) and testing tools.
