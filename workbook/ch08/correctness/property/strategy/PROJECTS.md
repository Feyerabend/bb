#### 1. *Extend the Framework with a List Strategy*

You can create a new `ListStrategy` class that generates lists of elements using
an existing strategy (e.g., integers or strings) and supports configurable minimum
and maximum lengths.  
- *Objectives*: Implement `generate` to produce random lists with size influenced
  by the `size` parameter, and `shrink` to simplify lists by removing elements,
  shortening them, or shrinking individual items. Test it by generating sample
  lists and shrinking them.  
- *Why it's useful*: This adds support for sequential data, allowing you to test
  functions like sorting algorithms.  
- *Skills developed*: Inheritance from abstract classes, iterator usage, and
  basic randomness handling.  
- *Difficulty*: Beginner.


#### 2. *Build a Simple Test Runner*

You can develop a function or class that uses the strategies to automatically run
property-based tests on a given function. For example, generate 100 test cases,
check if the function passes a property (like "reversing a tuple twice returns the
original"), and shrink any failing cases to find the minimal input.  
- *Objectives*: Integrate generation and shrinking into a loop that reports results,
  including the smallest failing example. Add options for seeding randomness and
  limiting test runs.  
- *Why it's useful*: This turns the code into a usable testing tool, similar to
  how Hypothesis runs tests.  
- *Skills developed*: Function composition, error handling, and basic reporting
  (e.g., printing results).  
- *Difficulty*: Intermediate.


#### 3. *Add Support for Floating-Point Numbers*

You can implement a `FloatStrategy` for generating and shrinking floating-point numbers within a range, handling edge cases like NaN, infinity, and precision issues.  
- *Objectives*: In `generate`, use `random.uniform` with size-adjusted bounds; in `shrink`, move values toward zero or integers by reducing magnitude or decimal places. Combine it with `TupleStrategy` to test math functions.  
- *Why it's useful*: Floats are common in scientific computing, and this helps test for floating-point errors.  
- *Skills developed*: Dealing with numeric precision, edge-case testing, and Python's `random` module.  
- *Difficulty*: Beginner to intermediate.


#### 4. *Create a Recursive Strategy for Tree Structures*

You can design a `TreeStrategy` that generates binary trees (or similar recursive structures) using a base strategy for node values, with depth controlled by the `size` hint to avoid infinite recursion.  
- *Objectives*: Use recursion in `generate` with a maximum depth, and in `shrink`, prune subtrees or simplify node values. Use it to test tree traversal functions.  
- *Why it's useful*: This extends the framework to hierarchical data, useful for algorithms like binary search trees.  
- *Skills developed*: Recursion, data structure implementation, and balancing complexity in generation.  
- *Difficulty*: Advanced.

#### 5. *Integrate with an Existing Testing Library*
You can adapt the framework to work with Python's `unittest` module by creating a mixin class that generates test data dynamically in test methods.  
- *Objectives*: Override `setUp` or use decorators to inject strategy-generated data into tests. Run examples like testing a custom dictionary implementation for correctness.  
- *Why it's useful*: This bridges your custom framework with standard tools, making it more practical for real projects.  
- *Skills developed*: Library integration, decorators, and unit testing best practices.  
- *Difficulty*: Intermediate.


#### 6. *Optimize Shrinking for Efficiency*

You can improve the shrinking process across strategies by prioritizing "better"
shrinks (e.g., using binary search to find minimal values faster instead of linear
iteration).  
- *Objectives*: Refactor `shrink` methods (e.g., in `IntegerStrategy`) to use
  techniques like halving intervals, and benchmark the time taken to shrink large
  values.  
- *Why it's useful*: Faster shrinking helps debug complex failures quicker,
  mimicking advanced libraries.  
- *Skills developed*: Algorithm optimization, performance profiling (e.g., with
  `timeit`), and iterator efficiency.  
- *Difficulty*: Advanced.


#### 7. *Apply the Framework to Test a Real-World Module*

You can use the existing strategies to test a small Python module you've written,
such as a simple calculator or string manipulator, by defining properties (e.g.,
"adding two positives yields a positive").  
- *Objectives*: Write 3-5 properties, generate test data, and document any bugs
  found through shrinking. Extend strategies as needed for your module's inputs.  
- *Why it's useful*: This shows the framework's practical value in catching edge
  cases.  
- *Skills developed*: Property definition, debugging with minimal examples, and
  applying testing to personal code.  
- *Difficulty*: Beginner.

These projects build directly on the code's structure, encouraging you to
experiment with abstraction, randomness, and testing principles. Start with
simpler ones to get comfortable, then scale up.
