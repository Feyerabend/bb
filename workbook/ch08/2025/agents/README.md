## Agents Now and Then

Agents--specifically AI agents--have become a central topic in the spring of 2025, with applications
ranging from autonomous web assistants to multi-agent coordination in complex systems. Yet the concept
itself has a much longer history. The idea of "software agents" dates back at least to the 1970s in
distributed computing, gaining formal traction in the 1980s through work on expert systems and
knowledge-based agents. In the 1990s, mobile agents--small programs capable of migrating between machines
and executing remotely--were actively explored as part of early internet and networked systems research.
These early visions emphasised autonomy, goal-driven behavior, and flexible interaction protocols, many
of which prefigure today's developments.

To provide some perspective on how these ideas were understood before the rise of LLMs and modern
infrastructure, Iâ€™ve included a short paper I wrote in 1997. While the style reflects the time--and
my non-native English--the core concepts remain strikingly relevant. The text touches on autonomy,
client-server dynamics, and communication models in ways that still resonate in current discussions
around intelligent agents.
