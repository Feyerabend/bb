## Dependent Types in Practice

The implementation uses dependent types to statically enforce matrix dimension rules:

1. *Construction* - Each matrix carries its dimensions (`rows×cols`) in its type

2. *Operations* - Type checker validates:
   - Multiplication: Columns(A) = Rows(B)
   - Indexing: Row/col indices < matrix dimensions

3. *Consistency* - All rows must match declared column count

This transforms what would be runtime errors in conventional languages into compile-time
type errors. The type system becomes:

1. A *proof system* - Matrix types mathematically prove correct dimensions

2. A *documentation tool* - Function signatures explicitly declare dimension requirements

3. A *correctness enforcer* - Invalid operations simply won't type-check

Types aren't just classifying data (e.g., "this is a matrix") but encoding mathematical
properties ("this is a 2×3 matrix of Nats") that can be mechanically verified before execution.
If these ideas are taken further into implementation, the presumed compiler becomes an
*automated theorem prover* for matrix operations.


### Output Analysis: First part

__1. *Matrix A Type*__
   ```
   Matrix[succ(succ(0)),succ(succ(succ(0)))](Nat)
   ```
   - This represents a 2×3 matrix (2 rows, 3 columns) of natural numbers
   - `succ(succ(0))` = 2 rows
   - `succ(succ(succ(0)))` = 3 columns

__2. *Matrix B Type*__
   ```
   Matrix[succ(succ(succ(0))),succ(succ(0))](Nat)
   ```
   - This represents a 3×2 matrix (3 rows, 2 columns) of natural numbers
   - Properly shows the transpose dimensions from Matrix A

__3. *Matrix Multiplication Type*__
   ```
   Matrix[succ(succ(0)),succ(succ(0))](Nat)
   ```
   - Shows the correct resulting type of multiplying 2×3 × 3×2 = 2×2 matrix
   - The type system correctly tracks the dimension changes through multiplication

__4. *Expected Type Error*__
   ```
   Row length succ(0) doesn't match matrix cols succ(succ(0))
   ```
   - This shows the type checker catching an invalid matrix construction
   - Tried to add a row of length 1 (`succ(0)`) to a matrix expecting rows of length 2 (`succ(succ(0))`)
   - Exactly what we want from a dependent type system - catching dimension mismatches at "compile time"

### Why This Is Correct

1. *Dimension Tracking*: The system properly tracks matrix dimensions through:
   - Construction (via `matrix()` helper)
   - Operations (like multiplication)
   - Error cases (mismatched dimensions)

2. *Type Safety*: The operations are type-safe:
   - Can only multiply compatible matrices (inner dimensions match)
   - All elements are verified to be natural numbers
   - Row lengths must be consistent

3. *Error Detection*: Catches invalid operations:
   - Mismatched row lengths
   - Invalid multiplication dimensions
   - Type mismatches


### Output Analysis: Second Part

__1. *1×1 Matrix Type*__
   ```
   Matrix[succ(0),succ(0)](Nat)
   ```
   - Correctly shows a 1×1 matrix (1 row, 1 column) of natural numbers
   - `succ(0)` properly represents the number 1 in your Peano arithmetic implementation

__2. *Invalid Multiplication Error*__
   ```
   Cannot multiply succ(succ(0))xsucc(succ(succ(0))) by succ(succ(0))xsucc(succ(0))
   ```
   - Perfectly catches the dimension mismatch (trying to multiply 2×3 by 2×2)
   - The error message clearly shows the incompatible dimensions
   - This is exactly what we want - preventing invalid matrix multiplications at the type level

__3. *Element Access Type*__
   ```
   Nat
   ```
   - Correctly shows that accessing an element of a matrix returns a natural number
   - This matches our type definition where matrix elements are of type `Nat`


### Why This Is Right

1. *Dimensional Correctness*:
   - The type system maintains perfect tracking of matrix dimensions
   - All operations preserve or properly transform these dimensions

2. *Type Safety*:
   - Invalid operations are caught with clear error messages
   - Valid operations return the expected types

3. *Practical Validation*:
   - The 1×1 matrix test verifies basic matrix construction works
   - The multiplication test verifies dimension checking works
   - The element access test verifies the element type is preserved


### Conclusion

The script is:
- Tracking matrix dimensions in types
- Preventing invalid operations at compile-time
- Maintaining proper typing of all operations
- Providing clear error messages when rules are violated

This is how a dependently-typed matrix system should behave. The output proves the
type checker is working correctly for all *these* cases.
