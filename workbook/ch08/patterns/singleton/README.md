## Singleton

The `Singleton` pattern, as originally defined by the Gang of Four, ensures that a class has
only one instance and provides a global access point to it. This sounds simple and sometimes
even desirable--think of logging systems, configuration managers, or connection pools. But
over time, this pattern has developed a notorious reputation in modern software design,
primarily because of the hidden complexity and coupling it introduces.


Key Problems with Singleton:

__1. Global State in Disguise__

A `Singleton` often behaves like a global variable. This breaks encapsulation and introduces
implicit dependencies. Functions or classes that use a `Singleton` may appear independent in
their interface, but actually depend on hidden shared state. This makes the system:
- Hard to reason about
- Difficult to test
- Fragile in concurrent or distributed contexts


__2. Tight Coupling__

Once components rely directly on a `Singleton`, they are tightly bound to its presence and behaviour.
This makes code harder to change or refactor--swapping in a different implementation becomes non-trivial.


__3. Inhibits Testing__

In unit tests, you typically want to mock or replace dependencies. With a `Singleton`, the instance is
baked into the code and usually resists substitution. This leads to:
- Test order dependencies
- Accidental state sharing between tests
- The need for ugly "reset" hacks


__4. Concurrency Risks__

Since the `Singleton` is a shared object, any mutable state it holds must be protected from race
conditions. In a multithreaded environment, that means additional synchronisation complexity--mutexes,
locks, or atomic operations.


__5. Namespace Pollution__

`Singletons` often become dumping grounds for unrelated logic because "there's already a place for
shared things." This leads to bloated classes with poor cohesion.


### Modern Alternatives

Instead of the traditional `Singleton` pattern, modern design leans on:
- *Dependency Injection* (DI): Pass shared instances explicitly where needed.
  This makes dependencies visible and testable.
- *Service Locators* (used sparingly): Centralised registries that can provide
  services when truly needed, but with the tradeoff of implicit coupling.
- *Module-level singletons* (in Python, JS, etc.): Relying on language/module
  behaviour to ensure single instantiation without enforcing it via class structure.

In short: can be problematic when overused or used without understanding the implications.
It makes global state seem structured, but itâ€™s still global state, and it drags all the
same problems with it.
