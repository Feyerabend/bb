## State Mechanics vs State Pattern

| Aspect | Automata (DFA/NFA/PDA/TM) | State Pattern (Design Pattern) |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Purpose | Model computation and recognise languages | Encapsulate varying behaviour in OO systems |
| Inputs | External symbols (from alphabet) | Method calls (client code interaction) |
| Outputs | Accept/reject (and sometimes side-effects) | Varying behaviour via polymorphism |
| Transition Function | Explicit formal mapping | Dynamic method dispatch |
| Memory | None (DFA/NFA), Stack (PDA), Infinite tape (TM) | Instance variables / object graph |
| State Change Trigger | Input symbol | Method call / internal logic |
| State Representation | Formal set of states (Q), explicit transitions | Concrete classes implementing a State interface |
| Flexibility | Fixed after design (static) | Can add/modify states dynamically (more extensible) |
| Typical Use | Parsers, protocol models, computation theory | UI workflows, game objects, business rules |
| Composability | States and transitions are atomic | States can share behaviour (inheritance/composition) |


1. State Pattern is not driven by external input sequences
Automata consume external symbols from an input string;
State Pattern usually changes based on method calls or context changes, not a predefined symbol stream.

2. Automata are declarative / formal; State Pattern is procedural / pragmatic
Automata are “proof objects” — used to describe languages, prove decidability.
State Pattern is about code organisation, not computation limits.

3. Extensibility
Automata have a fixed state set (you don’t add new states at runtime).
State Pattern can be extended by adding new State classes without modifying existing code (Open/Closed principle).

4. Memory
In automata, “memory” means formal auxiliary storage (none, stack, tape).
In State Pattern, states can carry complex instance state and dependencies (not modeled in automata).

5. Reusability and polymorphism
Automata states don’t share behaviour — they’re just abstract labels + transitions.
In State Pattern, states can share code (inheritance, mixins, delegation).

6. Semantic difference
Automata are about recognition (deciding).
State Pattern is about delegation (organising code paths).
