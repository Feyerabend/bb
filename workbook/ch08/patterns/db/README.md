This database is a simple in-memory SQL-like system built on a binary search tree. It is designed for learning and experimentation, and does not support many features found in full-scale database management systems.

The database does not support transactions, concurrency, or advanced SQL features such as joins or indexes. It is case-sensitive for both column names and values. SQL injection prevention is not implemented, and the system does not enforce data validation or constraints.

It does not support foreign keys or relationships between tables, and there is no support for advanced or custom data types. Backup, restore, or data migration features are not provided. Schema evolution is also not supported.

User authentication, access control, data encryption, and other security-related features are not available. The database lacks logging, auditing, performance tuning, or optimization capabilities.

There is no functionality for importing, exporting, visualizing, or reporting data. It does not include features for data analysis, machine learning, or big data processing. Integration with cloud platforms or distributed systems is not supported.

The system does not support NoSQL, document-based, graph, time-series, or spatial/geospatial database features. Full-text search and indexing are not available. There is no support for data partitioning, sharding, replication, clustering, high availability, failover, load balancing, or caching.

Monitoring, alerting, APIs, and integration with external systems or tools are not provided. Additionally, the database does not support any data governance, compliance, privacy, or protection features.

Lifecycle management, data archiving, retention policies, data quality control, cleansing, profiling, discovery, lineage, mapping, cataloging, metadata management, modeling, design, interoperability, semantics, or ontology support are all out of scope.
