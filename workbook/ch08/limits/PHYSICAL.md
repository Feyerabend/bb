## Physical Constraints

Computation is not just an abstract mathematical process--it is also constrained by the physical laws of the universe.
One of the most fundamental limits is the *Landauer Limit*, which establishes a connection between information theory and
thermodynamics. Rolf Landauer (1961) demonstrated that erasing a single bit of information requires a minimum amount
of energy, given by

```math
E = kT \ln 2
```

where $\`k\`$ is Boltzmann's constant $\`\approx 1.38 \times 10^{-23} J/K\`$, and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin. This
result arises because erasing a bit corresponds to irreversibly increasing entropy, converting ordered information
into heat. While logically reversible computations (such as those in reversible computing models) could, in principle,
avoid this energy cost, practical computers constantly perform irreversible operations (like overwriting memory),
leading to inevitable energy dissipation.

This thermodynamic constraint has real-world consequences for computing efficiency. As computational systems scale up,
energy dissipation becomes a critical bottleneck. Modern processors are already reaching thermal limits, where cooling
and power consumption become major concerns. The Landauer Limit sets a fundamental boundary: no matter how efficient
a computer is, it cannot perform irreversible operations without expending energy.

Beyond thermodynamics, other physical constraints arise from the nature of space, time, and quantum mechanics. The speed
of light imposes a limit on how fast information can travel within a processor. As circuits become smaller and clock
speeds increase, signals must propagate across shorter distances in increasingly limited timeframes. At GHz frequencies,
even light or electrical signals take noticeable fractions of a nanosecond to traverse a chip, constraining further
improvements in classical processor speeds.

An even more pressing issue is the shrinking size of transistors. Modern semiconductor technology, following Moore's
Law, has reduced transistor sizes to just a few nanometers. However, as transistors approach the atomic scale, they
begin to suffer from quantum mechanical effects, such as:

- *Quantum uncertainty*, which makes precise control of electron locations difficult.
- *Quantum tunneling*, where electrons pass through barriers they classically shouldn't,
  causing leakage currents that interfere with reliable computation.

These quantum effects make classical digital computation unreliable at extremely small scales, limiting further
transistor miniaturisation. This has led to the exploration of new computing paradigms, including:

1. Quantum computing, which harnesses quantum superposition and entanglement to perform
   computations that classical systems struggle with, such as factoring large numbers
   efficiently (Shor's algorithm) or simulating quantum systems.

2. Reversible computing, which aims to minimise energy dissipation by avoiding unnecessary
   erasure of information.

3. Neuromorphic and alternative architectures, such as memristors and optical computing,
   which attempt to bypass the limitations of classical transistors.

Ultimately, computation is fundamentally bound by the laws of physics, from the thermodynamics of information
processing to the quantum mechanical behaviour of transistors. While classical computing is facing physical
constraints, emerging technologies like quantum computing and energy-efficient architectures offer potential
paths forward.
