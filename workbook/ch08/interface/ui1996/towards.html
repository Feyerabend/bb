<H3>Towards a New Design of Graphical Interfaces:</H3>
<H3>Historical Concepts Systemized</H3>

<p class="start">
Downbelow I intend to discuss some principles with regard to what has recently
been annonced: the HotJava Views. The intresting part of it, besides beeing the
first application of the Sun NC, is the reinvention of a simplified graphical
interface. In principal it resemble the revival of the terminal, by its interior
as well as exterior.

<p>First I will discuss some general observations of graphics and wordprocessing.
Secondly I will try to summarize some designprinciples of HotJava Views as they
are described at Suns site. Then I will declare where I think the graphics of
computers are heading in the future.

<p>The graphical control on microcomputers especially, has changed during the
last two decades. They have become more, and still more, graphical. Also some
steering equipment has been added, such as the mouse. The archetype of
contemporary Graphical User Interface is probably the Apple Macintosh Computer.
If we for the moment avoid all the intresting details per se from the history,
Macintosh and Microsoft Windows shapes the contours of a persistent computer face
with all of its good, bad and ugly features.

<p>Let me from a naive standpoint of view, revise some of its qualities without
having any formal background, but only depart from some 17 years experiences with
microcomputers and their interfaces.

<H4>Control and Steering</H4>

<p class="start">
In 1994 I wrote a document, or a sort of paper describing some philosophical
aspects of wordprocessing. My idea was partly to build a discussion with others
with the some kind of intrest, and also that one perhaps could outline a combined
historical and philosophical approach to electronical text, and thereby builing
some sort of a foundation for a new part of a computer science. Still computer
science doesn't give more than a classification of kinds (inventory) it find
within its fields, and seldom reflects in depth on its purpose.

<p>The paper describe the control of wordprocessing and computer as abstracted.
The control can be divided into threee categories. Disregarding lamps and
switches from the earliest computers, the still surviving group are probably
keyboard commands and dedicated keys on the keyboard. The second group are
alphanumerical commands, the newly invented dialogs and menus which can be
manipulated from the keyboard, but also with cursors and the mouse. The third are
the use of symbols, pictures, icons, toolbars, rules controlled by mouse and the
screen cursor.

<H5>The Keyboard Codes</H5>

<p class="start">
Many keyboard commands and dedicated keys, resemble the typewriter. The
response is immediate and often means (non-ambiguous) single events. The
uppercase key locks the keyboard, and only uppercase letters result. The
tabulator key puts the cursor at the next stop, and also adds an invisible tabkey
code to the text (control character). The arrowkeys moves the cursor throw the
text. But the number of commands are nowadays often so large that the keyboard
would grow to an enourmous apparatus, if all control were in the hands of the
keyboard.

<p>Commands given by keyboard combinations (command keys) reduces the number of
dedicated keys, but increases the complexity of coding by enlarging cryptical
keyboard codes.

<p>Then there are also a lot of extras which have been developed during the years
the digital palette, lightpen, mouse, steering devices of the cursor etc. not to
mention "visual reality". Control doesn't have to be limited to the hand. It
could be extended to the voice or the foot. This have been possible for some
time, but voicecontrol for instance, hasn't been too sucessful yet. It did exist
on the Apple II, and nowadays Microsoft try hard to do it again.

<H5>The Alphanumerical Control</H5>

<p class="start">
Commands can be given short desciptions, which are interpreted by the program.
Suppose you want to add some lines to a textfile. You could be giving the program
an order "a" for adding, write the lines and end with a single "." (dot) on the
last line. Both the "a" and "." are commands to the editor. The written lines do
include there own dots, but are treated as uninterpreted text (data). Command
mode are seperated from text mode by conventions the wordprocessor defines. Maybe
you also would add a decided number of lines, lets say eight giving "a8" as the
command. Ofcourse the editors can be given precise numerical arguments, and both
longer and more commands.

<p>It's essential that both types of commands, keyboard and alphanumerical model
are directly accessible, although part cryptic. The alphanumerical direction
could be developed into liguistic interfaces, which "understands" natural
language. For instance database access would be an appropiate area.
Wordprocessing wouldn't benefit, as natural explanations often are cumbersome
than simple codes, "move line 3 down to line 8 and paste in after the line."

<H5>Menues and Dialogs</H5>

<p class="start">
The alphanumerical group also contains menues and dialogs, which are more or
less replacing the older keyboard alphanumerical control. Menues are mostly
hiearchial. From implementation often only one way can be selected between
alternatives. Alternatives are declared by short descriptions, less cryptic and
placed in an order that easily can be remembered. A correct design must probably
be "intuitive" or easily memorized. To expand the choises for several
alternatives, dialogs have been cut. Here it is possible to select several
alternatives at the same time, and specify numerical precision e.g. The program
halts, informs and require interaction from the user.

<H5>The Command of the Symbol</H5>

<p class="start">
Lastly, there is a third category where the advanced graphical techniques are
used together with the mouse and cursor. The visual rethoric have developed
symbols, buttons, markers, icons, toolbars, rulers etc. Operating systems today
have symbols (icons) och long filenames instead of alphanumerical mnemonic names
with maybe only eight plus three characters. Alphanumerical command modes have
been replaced with cursors, moves of symbols between windows and half animated
techniques. Symbols of arrows in a window represents commands, such as to move
the visible part of the textarea to a new place by moving the area. No doubt has
the graphic enhanced different commands accessibility. <em>Accessibility</em>
here becomes the combination of control and the habit of the user. But as the
keyboard once grow, alphanumerical commands became a forrest of hard percived and
many ill kinds, menues tend to become conceptual heaps where they no longer
remain intuitive, also the symbolic language can be drowned by its own wealth.

<H5>The Picture Command</H5>

<p class="start">
The category of symbols also contain the picture in a very special sense.
Usually symbols (icons) are non-ambiguous non-animated small pictures. Some times
too small. But they are intended to give the user a definite signal about its
effect, its function. A well developed picture command would on the other hand be
much more dynamic and useful with regard to the possible change of pictures. Some
sort of precision though must be added. The picture remains a sketch.
Wordprocessors have graphical display functions, which show a miniature of the
document to the screen. These have not been used to give commands in any extended
way yet. But they could be, and as they do they approach the layout programs. The
layout programs do apply the picture command in principal. Functions of
disposition also capture some of the idea of the picture command. In general and
with regard to the wordprocessor, it would be helpful to have standard solutions,
such as index of pictures, contens, lists, tables, etc. sometimes easier to carry
out with a typewriter than a wordprocessor.

the Macintosh Computer. Icon for tools given to the left, such as directly
printing the pages, alter marginals, or adding time and date.</em>

<p>The types of controls overlaps each other in ways to control wordprocessing.
Some rational model for building the wordprocessors have not been used. Instead
they are built upon series of historical circumstances. Symptoms of this is e.g.
functions which are doubled in categories. Measurements could be done of precision
and speed for instance. Increased speed tend to be linguistic control
(alphanumerical, dialog) rather than graphical, and vise versa decreased
precision. The more objective speed could be balanced against accessability. A
keyboard command and a menu command are often equal with regard to efficiency
each separately at each occasion. But the key is faster than the menu. When a
beginner finds accessibility more difficult by the key, an experienced user could
find the opposite hold.
