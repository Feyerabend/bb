<H3>Towards a New Design of Graphical Interfaces:</H3>
<H3>Setting a New Example</H3>

<p class="start">
The HotJava Views have no desktop, no double-clicking, no menues, no file
management and no handling, no settings panels, and as a consequence it has much
simplified graphical interface compared with old style notions. It has picture
commands, button rows, single-clicking, and inherits the overall design much
from old terminals as well as new browsers. It has a certain restriction, a
certain audience, a certain target: the transaction workers. But perhaps most
revolutionary, the users need no operating system to communicate with.

<H4>Need of an Operating System?</H4>

<p class="start">
Microsoft could (and I believe do) find Java threatning as it doesn't suppose
an operating system at all needed to let users communicate with computers. The
operating system is hidden from the users. The graphical interface have for a
long time reflected not only physical, but lately logical, structure of operating
systems. It has in fact been the only way for the user to get in control of the
thing. Microsoft build its dominance on the operating system and lately graphical
interface. Nowadays the Sun dictum "the computer as the net" becomes a reality.
Microsoft defend their old dictum, they tell us the net is simply an <em>extension
of the operating system</em>. (The evidence is e.g. that the file management of
the local operating system soon can handle file in the distant as well as those
locally.)

<p>The operating system has also been a passive recepient of stimuli from the
user. Soon Microsoft will launch a helping hand, a wizard which direct the user
when it is in trouble having problems. A sort of active ingredience. Soon IBM
launch a version of OS/2 which communicate with the user be responing with
actions taken in response to speech. Still, if there is no need for an operating
system, why improve communication? Shouldn't we start at the user, what the user
needs to communicate with? If we do need some system, shouldn't this be a graphical
interface which reflects the end use and not the system itself?

<p>Probably both Microsoft and Apple, for instance, would adhere to these
statements and continue to disregard their consequences. It is because they
design, and redesign interfaces, not entirely from the end user, but from
features, experiments etc. of <em>existing or experimental systems</em> tested.
It is still design as a result of and from testing. No revolution. If we accept a
compromise which Sun did with regard to HotJava Views, we should build interfaces
from good models. Apple once did this, and not as they later did adopting the
testing strategy. Suns model for HotJava Views were terminals and the
object-oriented model from Java itself. If we think of a more general approach
than the HotJava Views which continue the autonomy model from local computing,
the desktop computer perhaps model from the object-oriented (OO) approach. And we
keep both the rudimentary terminal as well as the desktop autonomy at a distant.

<H4>Suggestion of an Object-Oriented Interface</H4>

<p class="start">
Still, could OO be developed into a new design of graphical interfaces? There
isn't much which perhaps should be associated with a object-oriented interface.
But perhaps there is also some inspiration which could be taken from this.

<p>The OO model has to begin with objects and methods, the most elementary keys of
its existance. If we take this literary, we have actions corresponding to methods
(or behaviour) and objects which exist in spaces. Let us represent the spaces
with two-dimensional sheets in which objects can be put. To this we add a top-level
set of methods, the system-methods. Thus we have no need for files as they can become
objects of sorts, and we have no desktop metaphor.

<p>The methods will change as different objects are choosen. If the objects are
to interact with the user they will have to meet certain standards by the system.
As the command tables do not naturally group or create clusters, they'll have to 
follow specific conventions. These are determined by already existing traditions.
They can also interact with each other, but also choose not to communicate with
the user.

<p>The system methods which the user can interact with are represented by command
tables. The command tables are not exacly as drop-down menues. Nor like
different sorts of dialogs. They combine the menu and dialog capabities. They can
also change in ways dialogs and menus do not. They can consist of graphical
picture commands. Depending on the context, i.e. the objects choosen, they change
accordingly. The system objects are represented in sheets, and thus not choosen
from the command tables.

<em>Picture 3. 
Top-level view of a hypothetical graphical interface. The flaps of the command
tables are seen to the right hand side, and at the lower edge.</em>

<p>A system method "interaction" can avoid the troubles of getting along with the
menus. Interact can give warnings which must be seen, as they popup from the
bottom of the screen. The user can interact directly with the system by a prompt
inside interaction. Each command from the menu, and each selction, or precision
detail can be given in a prompt command. You can also read its history. Questions
like where to find anything or help may be given in a natural language directly
to the computer. The prompt command may be much faster than the natural language
question or the menu commands, why the pompt continues to live. Here also
connections between keyboard commands and table commands, can be set and changed
to a personal profile or ridgid convention.

<p>Thus they inherit the resemblance to files which become objects. The file-system
becomes objects in different spaces, which are displayed on the screen as
representations of objects on sheets. It doesn't matter if the actual object is far
away from the user, they appear as representations on the screen.
