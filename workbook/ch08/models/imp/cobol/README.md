## The Story of COBOL

In the late 1950s, the computing world was a chaotic frontier. Computers were hulking machines,
each speaking its own bespoke dialect of machine code or assembly language. Businesses—banks,
insurance companies, and government agencies—were beginning to see the potential of computers
for managing vast amounts of data, but programming them was a laborious, error-prone task reserved
for engineers and mathematicians. The need for a standardized, accessible programming language
tailored to business applications was palpable.

Enter the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a major player in early computing due to its vast
logistical and financial operations. In 1959, the DoD convened a meeting with computer manufacturers,
users, and academics to address this problem. The result was the Conference on Data Systems
Languages (CODASYL), tasked with designing a common business-oriented language. The committee,
influenced by pioneers like *Grace Hopper*, who had developed FLOW-MATIC (a language with
English-like syntax for data processing), aimed to create a language that was:

- Readable by non-programmers, such as business managers.
- Portable across different manufacturers' machines.
- Focused on data processing—handling records, files, and calculations for business tasks.

By 1960, COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) was born. Its first specification, COBOL-60,
was a compromise among competing interests: IBM, Remington Rand, and others wanted a language
that worked on their hardware, while users demanded simplicity. Grace Hopper's vision of
English-like syntax won out, giving COBOL its verbose, self-documenting style
(e.g., ADD AMOUNT TO TOTAL instead of cryptic symbols).


### Why COBOL Looks the Way It Does

COBOL's distinctive appearance—verbose, rigidly structured, and column-dependent—stems from
its historical context and technical constraints.


__Punch Card Legacy__

In the 1950s and 1960s, programs were written on 80-column punch cards (the "standard" of 80 will
persist over the years in terminals), where each column represented a character.
COBOL's fixed-format structure was designed to fit this medium:
- Columns 1–6: Sequence numbers for sorting cards (in case they were dropped).
- Column 7: Indicators (e.g., * for comments, - for continuations).
- Columns 8–11 (Area A): Division headers, section names, and top-level data items.
- Columns 12–72 (Area B): Executable statements and subordinate data definitions.
- Columns 73–80: Program identification (often ignored).

This columnar layout explains why COBOL code appears aligned to specific positions
(e.g., division headers at column 8, statements at column 12). Misaligned code could
cause compiler errors, as parsers expected text in precise columns.


__English-Like Syntax__

COBOL was designed to be readable by businesspeople, not just programmers. Commands like MOVE,
DISPLAY, ADD, and SUBTRACT mimic natural language, and structures like WORKING-STORAGE SECTION
are descriptive. This verbosity (e.g., PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 10) was
intentional to make code self-documenting, reducing the need for separate documentation.


__Machine Dependence__

Early computers (e.g., IBM 1401, UNIVAC, Burroughs) had different architectures, character sets,
and memory constraints. COBOL's portability goal meant it had to abstract these differences,
but its appearance varied slightly by machine:

- Character Sets: Some machines lacked lowercase letters or certain symbols, so COBOL used
  uppercase and avoided special characters.
- Compiler Quirks: Different vendors' compilers enforced column rules variably or added
  proprietary extensions, leading to slight formatting differences.
- Punch Card Variations: Some systems used 80-column cards, others 96, affecting how
  programmers spaced their code.

As a result, COBOL code on an IBM mainframe might look slightly different (e.g., stricter
column alignment) than on a Burroughs machine, though the core syntax remained consistent.


__Business Focus__

COBOL's structure reflects its purpose: processing large datasets (e.g., payroll, inventory).
The DATA DIVISION (for defining records) and PROCEDURE DIVISION (for logic) mirror business
workflows—define data, then process it. This led to hierarchical, verbose data declarations
(e.g., 01 EMPLOYEE-RECORD. 05 EMP-NAME PIC X(30).), which look bulky but map directly to
fixed-length records on tape or disk.


### Evolution and Impact

__The 1960s–1970s: COBOL's Golden Age__

COBOL quickly became the lingua franca of business computing. By the mid-1960s, it was supported
on most major platforms, from IBM System/360 to Honeywell and DEC machines. Its standardization
(via CODASYL and later ANSI) ensured portability, and its readability made it accessible to a
growing pool of programmers trained in business applications.

- Adoption: Banks, insurance companies, and governments adopted COBOL for transaction processing,
  accounting, and record-keeping. By the 1970s, an estimated 80% of business applications were
  written in COBOL.
- Updates: COBOL-68 and COBOL-74 introduced features like structured programming (PERFORM loops)
  and better file handling, though the language remained verbose to maintain backward compatibility.
- Cultural Impact: COBOL democratised programming, enabling non-scientists to write software.
  Training programs flourished, creating a generation of COBOL programmers, many of whom were women,
  thanks to pioneers like Grace Hopper. In a way it was equally important in its area as BASIC
  in education or Python today, letting non-programmers take some control over the computer.

__The 1980s–1990s: Challenges and Resilience__

As computing evolved, COBOL faced criticism:

- Verbosity: Newer languages like C and Pascal were concise and suited for systems programming,
  making COBOL seem outdated.
- Mainframe bias: COBOL was tied to expensive mainframes, while PCs and minicomputers gained popularity.
- Academic 'snobbery': Computer scientists favored "elegant" languages, dismissing COBOL as clunky.

Yet COBOL persisted:

- COBOL-85: Added modern features like scope terminators (END-IF, END-PERFORM), improving structured
  programming.
- Legacy Systems: Businesses had invested billions in COBOL systems, and rewriting them was costly
  and risky. COBOL's reliability kept it entrenched in finance, insurance, and government.
- Y2K Crisis: In the late 1990s, COBOL's two-digit year fields (e.g., PIC 99 for years) caused panic
  over potential system failures. Companies hired COBOL programmers to fix millions of lines of code,
  highlighting the language's enduring presence. And when no one could be found, educational programs
  were set up.

__The 2000s–Present: COBOL's Quiet Endurance__

COBOL remains a backbone of enterprise computing:

- Modernization: COBOL-2002 and COBOL-2014 added object-oriented programming, XML support, and free-format
  mode (relaxing column rules). Compilers like IBM Enterprise COBOL and Micro Focus COBOL integrate with
  Java, .NET, and cloud platforms.
- Prevalence: Estimates suggest 200–300 billion lines of COBOL code are still in use, powering 70–80%
  of global financial transactions. Systems like bank ATMs, airline reservations, and Social Security
  rely on COBOL (which not only goes for USA, but several european countries as well).
- COVID-19: In 2020, U.S. unemployment systems (written in COBOL) struggled to handle pandemic-era
  claims, exposing a shortage of COBOL programmers and prompting calls to modernize or maintain these
  systems.
- Changes of systems where COBOL is used will continue ..

### Strengths and Criticisms

__Strengths__

- Reliability: COBOL systems are battle-tested, running mission-critical applications for decades without failure.
- Readability: Its English-like syntax makes it accessible and maintainable, especially for business logic.
- Portability: Standardization allowed COBOL to run across vendors' machines, a feat in the 1960s.
- Data Processing: COBOL excels at handling large, structured datasets, unmatched by many modern languages.

__Criticisms__

- Verbosity: Code is lengthy (e.g., 100 lines of COBOL might do what 10 lines of Python can), increasing development time.
- Rigidity: The fixed-format structure and lack of modern constructs (until later versions) made it cumbersome.
- Perception: COBOL is often seen as "old" or "irrelevant," deterring young programmers, though this is partly
  unfair given its ongoing use.
- Maintenance Costs: Aging COBOL systems require specialized skills, and the programmer shortage drives up costs.


### COBOL Today and Tomorrow

COBOL is neither dead nor dying, but it's not thriving either. It's a survivor, quietly powering the world's
financial and administrative backbone. Modernization efforts include:

- Integration: COBOL runs on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) and interfaces with APIs and web services.
- Training: Initiatives like IBM's COBOL training programs aim to bridge the skills gap.
- Replacement vs. Maintenance: Some organizations rewrite COBOL systems in Java or Python, but others find
  maintaining COBOL cheaper and less risky, given its reliability.

The language's future depends on:

- Economics: Will businesses invest in rewriting stable systems?
- Education: Will new programmers learn COBOL, or will automation tools (e.g., AI-driven code translators)
  reduce the need?
- Innovation: Can COBOL compilers evolve to stay relevant in a cloud-native world?


### Conclusion

COBOL's legacy is both a blessing and a curse, encapsulated in its design mantra: built for business,
built to last. Its English-like syntax and robust data-processing capabilities made it the backbone of
enterprise systems, powering banks, governments, and insurers for over six decades. This durability is
a blessing—hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL code process 70–80% of global financial transactions
with unmatched reliability. Yet, it's also a curse: its verbosity, rooted in punch-card origins, feels
archaic, and its columnar structure, tailored to 1960s hardware, resists modernization. The scarcity of
COBOL programmers, coupled with the high cost of replacing stable systems, traps organizations in a cycle
of maintenance. COBOL's enduring presence, a testament to its pragmatic design, underscores a paradox:
a language so well-built for its time remains indispensable, yet burdensome, in a world that's moved on.
