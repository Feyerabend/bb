| Op Code | Syntax   | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1       | LIT 0, M  | Push constant value (literal) M onto the stack |
| 2       | OPR 0, M  | Operation to be performed on the data at the top of the stack |
|         | OPR 0, 0  | Return; used to return to the caller from a procedure. |
|         | OPR 0, 1  | Negation; pop the stack and return the negative of the value |
|         | OPR 0, 2  | Addition; pop two values from the stack, add and push the sum |
|         | OPR 0, 3  | Subtraction; pop two values from the stack, subtract second from first and push the difference |
|         | OPR 0, 4  | Multiplication; pop two values from the stack, multiply and push the product |
|         | OPR 0, 5  | Division; pop two values from the stack, divide second by first and push the quotient |
|         | OPR 0, 6  | Is odd? (divisible by two); pop the stack and push 1 if odd, 0 if even |
|         | OPR 0, 7  | Modulus; pop two values from the stack, divide second by first and push the remainder |
|         | OPR 0, 8  | Equality; pop two values from the stack and push 1 if equal, 0 if not |
|         | OPR 0, 9  | Inequality; pop two values from the stack and push 0 if equal, 1 if not |
|         | OPR 0, 10 | Less than; pop two values from the stack and push 1 if first is less than second, 0 if not |
|         | OPR 0, 11 | Less than or equal to; pop two values from the stack and push 1 if first is less than or equal to second, 0 if not |
|         | OPR 0, 12 | Greater than; pop two values from the stack and push 1 if first is greater than second, 0 if not |
|         | OPR 0, 13 | Greater than or equal to; pop two values from the stack and push 1 if first is greater than or equal to second, 0 if not |
| 3       | LOD L, M  | Load value to top of stack from the stack location at offset M from L lexicographical levels down |
| 4       | STO L, M  | Store value at top of stack in the stack location at offset M from L lexicographical levels down |
| 5       | CAL L, M  | Call procedure at code index M |
| 6       | INC 0, M  | Increment the stack pointer by M (allocate M locals); by convention, this is used as the first instruction of a procedure and will allocate space for the Static Link (SL), Dynamic Link (DL), and Return Address (RA) of an activation record |
| 7       | JMP 0, M  | Jump to instruction M |
| 8       | JPC 0, M  | Pop the top of the stack and jump to instruction M if it is equal to zero |
| 9       | SIO 0, 1  | Start I/O; pop the top of the stack and output the value |
| 10      | SIO 0, 2  | Start I/O; read input and push it onto the stack |
