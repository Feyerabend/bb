### Modern OO Features Added:

1. *Method Overloading*
   - Multiple `evaluate()` methods with different parameters in `ExpressionEvaluator`
   - Various `create()` factory methods in `NumberExp` with different parameter types
   - Different constructors in `Context` class

2. *Constructor Chaining*
   - `IntegerExp` uses constructor chaining for validation
   - `Context` chains constructors for different initialization scenarios
   - `BinaryExpression` uses a common constructor for all subclasses

3. *Static Factory Methods*
   - `NumberExp.create()` factory methods for creating different expression types
   - `IntegerExp.valueOf()` with caching for common integer values
   - `VariableExp.of()` as a named alternative to the constructor

4. *Builder Pattern*
   - `ExpressionBuilder` for fluent construction of complex expressions
   - `ContextBuilder` for configuring a context with variables
   - Supports method chaining with a terminal `build()` method

5. *Additional Design Patterns*
   - *Template Method Pattern*: Base behavior in `NumberExp` with specialized subclass implementations
   - *Visitor Pattern*: `ExpressionVisitor` interface for traversing expressions
   - *Facade Pattern*: `ExpressionEvaluator` simplifies interaction with the system
   - *Immutability*: Expression objects are immutable to prevent unexpected changes
   - *Fluent Interface*: Methods that return `this` for method chaining

6. *Proper Encapsulation*
   - Private fields with proper accessors
   - Immutable classes where appropriate
   - Validation in constructors to ensure object integrity

7. *Generics and Type Safety*
   - Using generics in visitor pattern and collections
   - Proper exception hierarchy and handling

### Key Improvements

1. The code is now more modular and follows SOLID principles
2. Added better abstraction with the template method pattern
3. Reduced code duplication with proper inheritance hierarchies
4. Enhanced type safety with proper generics
5. Added multiple ways to construct and compose expressions
6. Implemented the visitor pattern for expression traversal
7. Improved exception handling with a proper hierarchy

This enhanced interpreter demonstrates a comprehensive set of object-oriented design principles
and patterns while maintaining the core functionality of the original code.
