# SVG Renderer Architecture: Complete System Overview

## 1. Loading and Parsing Process

When you call `renderer.load_from_file()` or `load_from_string()`, the following happens:

1. **XML Parsing**: The SVGParser in `parsers/xml_parser.py` processes the XML content into a DOM-like structure.

2. **Element Creation**: For each XML node, the parser creates corresponding SVGElement objects (from `elements/` modules). For example, a `<rect>` tag becomes a `Rect` object.

3. **Attribute Processing**: Each element's attributes are parsed and stored:
   - Transforms are converted to Transform objects
   - Colors are normalized (handling hex, rgb(), named colors)
   - Units are converted as needed (px, em, %, etc.)

4. **CSS Processing**: Style attributes and CSS rules are parsed by `styling/css_parser.py` and applied to elements.

5. **Document Structure**: The renderer builds a tree structure mirroring the DOM, with parent-child relationships between elements.

## 2. Rendering Pipeline

When you call `renderer.render()`, the rendering process begins:

1. **Initialization**: A drawing context is created using the specified backend (Cairo, Pillow, etc.).

2. **ViewBox Setup**: The SVG's viewBox is processed by `utils/viewbox.py` to calculate the necessary transformations to fit the viewport.

3. **Hierarchical Rendering**: Elements are rendered in document order, with each element:
   - Applying inherited styles
   - Applying its own transformations
   - Rendering its content to the context
   - Delegating to children (if any)

4. **Render Phases**:
   - First pass: Render regular elements
   - Second pass: Render filter effects (if present)
   - Final pass: Apply any global effects

5. **Output**: The rendered image is saved to a file or returned as an image object.

## 3. Core Systems Interaction

### Coordinate Transformation System

Transformations are a central part of SVG rendering:

1. **Matrix Operations**: All transformations (translate, scale, rotate, skew) are represented as matrix operations in `transforms/matrix.py`.

2. **Transformation Chain**:
   - Global transformations from viewBox
   - Parent element transformations (inherited)
   - Current element's transformation
   - These are combined into a single transformation matrix

3. **Application**: When rendering, coordinates are transformed using this matrix to map from SVG coordinate space to output space.

### Styling System

Style properties cascade through the document:

1. **Style Resolution**:
   - User agent default styles
   - Document-level styles
   - Inherited styles from parent elements
   - Element-specific styles
   - Style attribute overrides

2. **Property Application**: Resolved styles are used to set stroke, fill, opacity, etc. on the rendering context.

### Path System

Paths are the most complex SVG elements:

1. **Path Parsing**: The path data string (the `d` attribute) is tokenized and parsed into a series of PathCommand objects.

2. **Command Execution**: Each command (MoveTo, LineTo, CurveTo, etc.) modifies the current point and draws to the context.

3. **Optimization**: Parsed path data is cached to avoid re-parsing for repeated renders.

## 4. Key Features and Implementation Details

### Element Composition

Elements can contain other elements, creating a tree structure:

1. **Group Elements**: `<g>` tags create groupings with shared attributes.

2. **Definitions**: `<defs>` sections contain reusable elements like gradients.

3. **Use Elements**: `<use>` tags reference and clone other elements.

### Gradient and Pattern Support

For complex fills:

1. **Definition**: Gradients/patterns are defined in the `<defs>` section.

2. **Reference**: Elements reference these by ID in their `fill` or `stroke` attributes.

3. **Rendering**: When encountered, the renderer creates the appropriate paint server (gradient or pattern) and applies it.

### Text Handling

Text rendering involves:

1. **Font Selection**: Finding the closest matching font based on CSS properties.

2. **Text Layout**: Positioning characters with proper spacing and alignment.

3. **Text Path**: For text flowing along a path, coordinates are calculated from the path geometry.

## 5. Working Together: A Concrete Example

Let's trace through a simple example:

```xml
<svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <g transform="translate(10,10)">
    <rect x="0" y="0" width="50" height="30" fill="blue" />
    <circle cx="70" cy="50" r="20" fill="red" />
  </g>
</svg>
```

1. **Parsing**: The SVG is parsed into an SVG object containing a Group with two children: Rect and Circle.

2. **ViewBox**: A transformation is created to map the 100×100 user space to the 200×200 output size.

3. **Group Transform**: The translate(10,10) is converted to a Transform matrix.

4. **Element Rendering**:
   - The Rect applies the viewBox transform and group transform, then draws a blue rectangle
   - The Circle similarly applies transforms, then draws a red circle

5. **Output**: The final image is produced with the properly positioned and styled elements.

## 6. Extension Points

The architecture is designed for extension:

1. **New Elements**: Add new element classes by subclassing SVGElement.

2. **New Backends**: Implement rendering backends by creating adapter classes.

3. **Filters**: Add SVG filter effects by implementing filter operations.

4. **Animation**: The framework could be extended to support SMIL animation or CSS animations.

This architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for an SVG renderer that follows the SVG 1.1 specification while maintaining a clean, maintainable structure.
