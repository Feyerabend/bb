## Raft

*Raft* is a consensus algorithm designed to ensure that a distributed system
can maintain a consistent state across multiple nodes, even in the face of
network partitions or server failures. It is used in scenarios where you have
multiple servers (often called nodes) that need to agree on a sequence of
operations to ensure consistency, even when some of the nodes may fail or
become unreachable.

From Wikipedia[^raft]
> Raft achieves consensus via an elected leader. A server in a raft cluster is either a leader or a follower, and can be a candidate in the precise case of an election (leader unavailable). The leader is responsible for log replication to the followers. It regularly informs the followers of its existence by sending a heartbeat message. Each follower has a timeout (typically between 150 and 300 ms) in which it expects the heartbeat from the leader. The timeout is reset on receiving the heartbeat. If no heartbeat is received the follower changes its status to candidate and starts a leader election.

The Raft algorithm is designed to be more understandable than other consensus
algorithms like Paxos[^paxos] while providing similar guarantees.
The key features of Raft are:

1. *Leader Election*: Raft elects a leader among the nodes in the system.
   The leader is responsible for managing the log and ensuring consistency
   across followers. If the leader fails, a new leader is elected.

2. *Log Replication*: The leader appends entries to its log, and then
   replicates those entries to the follower nodes. Once the majority of
   nodes have confirmed the log entry, it is considered committed.

3. *Safety*: Raft ensures that only one leader exists at any time and
   that logs are consistent across nodes. If a node crashes and recovers,
   it can bring its log up to date by receiving entries from the leader.

4. *Log Compaction*: Over time, logs can become large. Raft uses mechanisms
   like snapshots and log trimming to manage log size and ensure efficient
   recovery from crashes.

Raft works in environments where you have multiple replicas of data, and the
goal is to ensure that all replicas stay consistent, even if some nodes fail.
Raft simplifies the process of building reliable, fault-tolerant distributed
systems by breaking down the consensus process into manageable components.

### A Database Example Using Raft

In this example, we've implemented a very simple distributed database system using
some of the the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure that a group of servers agree on the
state of the data stored within them. The setup reflects how Raft handles data
replication and ensures consistency across all participating servers.

This example demonstrates how Raft ensures strong consistency in a distributed
system by having all servers maintain the same state, even in the face of failures.
By replicating commands through log entries, Raft enables the system to remain
fault-tolerant while ensuring that a single source of truth (the shared database)
is maintained across all servers.


__1. Raft Servers__

Each server is a participant in the Raft protocol. The servers in this example
have different roles:

- *Leader*: The leader server is responsible for processing client commands,
  updating the database, and replicating the changes to the follower servers.
  It ensures that only one server handles client requests at a time.

- *Follower*: Follower servers replicate the log entries from the leader.
  They apply these changes to their own local database and remain passive
  unless they need to vote in an election.

- *Candidate*: If a follower server doesn't hear from the leader within a
  certain time period, it transitions to a candidate state and starts an
  election to become the leader. The server with the most votes wins the
  election and takes on the leader role.


__2. Shared Database__

In this setup, there is one shared database that all the servers keep synchronized:

- Single Database File: The database is stored in a single file (or set of files)
  that is replicated across all the servers. Each server holds a local copy of the
  database state. The database maintains a key-value store where data can be updated,
  and this data is reflected across the servers using Raft's log replication mechanism.

- Log Replication:
    - The leader server processes commands (like setting a value for a key) and appends
      the commands to its log.
    - The leader then replicates these log entries to its followers.
    - Once the majority of followers acknowledge the log entry, the leader commits the
      entry to its state and executes it on the database
      (e.g., updating a value in the key-value store).
    - Followers apply the log entries to their own local copies of the database,
      ensuring that all servers maintain the same state.


__3. Database Interaction__

- Client Commands: When a client sends a command (such as setting or getting a
  key-value pair), the leader server processes the command and writes it to its log.

- Command Execution: The leader updates its local copy of the database and then
  replicates the command to the follower servers by sending them the log entries.

- Log Entry Replication: Followers receive the log entries, append them to their
  own logs, and apply the changes to their local databases. This ensures that each
  server in the cluster eventually has the same state.

- Consistency and Fault Tolerance: Even if the leader crashes, a new leader is
  elected, and the system continues to ensure data consistency by replaying the
  logs on all servers to recover any missed changes. This process ensures that
  the database remains highly consistent and fault-tolerant.


__4. Practical Example__

In the provided implementation, we used a simple counter value stored in the
database to demonstrate Raft's operation:
- Initially, the database has a starting state (e.g., `{'counter':}`).
- As clients send commands (like setting the counter to a new value), the
  leader processes the commands, updates the database, and replicates the
  changes to the followers.
- The result is that all servers in the Raft cluster eventually have the
  same counter value, ensuring consistency across the system.
- The leader changes over time as the servers undergo elections, but the
  database state remains consistent.


### Why Use Raft for a Database?

1. *Consistency*:
   Raft ensures that all database servers (replicas) maintain the same state.
   Whether you have a single server or a distributed set of servers, Raft ensures
   that the data is consistent across all nodes, even in the case of failures
   or network partitions.

2. *Fault Tolerance*:
   By ensuring that logs are replicated to a majority of nodes, Raft provides
   fault tolerance. If the leader crashes or becomes unreachable, the system can
   still function by electing a new leader from the remaining servers. This
   guarantees that the database continues to operate even in failure scenarios.

3. *Leader-Driven*:
   The leader-based approach helps streamline certain aspects of the database
   operations. For example, the leader accepts client requests, processes them,
   and propagates them to followers. This reduces the complexity of dealing with
   race conditions or conflicts between replicas when handling client requests.

4. *Scalability*:
   Raft allows the addition of more servers to the cluster without requiring
   downtime. As the cluster grows, the system can handle more traffic while
   maintaining consistency. Each new server automatically starts replicating
   logs from the leader and is brought into the consensus process.

5. *Simplicity*:
   Raft's design is intentionally simpler to understand and implement compared
   to other consensus algorithms like Paxos. This makes it easier to build and
   maintain distributed systems, including databases.



### Applications of Raft

Raft is used in several real-world applications, particularly in systems that
require high availability, strong consistency, and fault tolerance. Some examples include:

1. Distributed Databases:
   Databases such as etcd, Consul, and CockroachDB use Raft to ensure consistency
   between replicas in a distributed environment. Raft ensures that all nodes agree
   on the state of the database and that no data is lost in the event of a failure.

2. Distributed File Systems:
   Raft is used to manage distributed file systems where files are replicated across
   multiple nodes. Raft ensures that file metadata and file content are consistent
   across all replicas.

3. Service Discovery:
   In microservices architectures, service discovery mechanisms like Consul use Raft
   to maintain a consistent view of the available services. This ensures that all
   nodes in the system have the latest service information.

4. Configuration Management:
   Tools like Consul and etcd, which are widely used for managing distributed system
   configurations, rely on Raft to ensure that configurations are consistently
   replicated and accessible across nodes.

5. Blockchain:
   While Raft is not directly used in blockchain technology (which typically uses
   other consensus mechanisms), its principles of ensuring consistency and fault
   tolerance have influenced blockchain design patterns.

6. Cloud-Native Applications:
   In cloud-native environments, where multiple replicas of services are needed for
   scalability and fault tolerance, Raft helps maintain consistency. Kubernetes, for
   example, uses etcd (which relies on Raft) to store and manage cluster state.



### Comparing Raft with Other Consensus Solutions

Raft is often compared with Paxos, another well-known consensus algorithm. While both
Paxos and Raft aim to solve the same problem of distributed consensus, Raft is generally
considered easier to understand and implement.

- Paxos: Paxos is mathematically rigorous and widely used but can be difficult to
  implement and understand, especially when considering real-world scenarios like
  network partitions or failures. It also has less well-defined leader election
  mechanics, which can complicate the process.

- Raft: Raft simplifies the consensus process by clearly defining the role of a
  leader, the mechanism for log replication, and how to handle elections and log
  consistency. Raft's leader-centric approach makes it easier to implement than
  Paxos, while still achieving strong consistency and fault tolerance.

Other consensus algorithms, such as Zab (used in Zookeeper) or Multi-Paxos, also provide
similar guarantees but may have different trade-offs or optimizations. Raft's focus on
simplicity makes it particularly suitable for use cases like distributed databases and
key-value stores.



### Conclusion

Raft is a critical component of distributed systems, especially for ensuring data consistency
across multiple servers. In the context of the example provided, we've demonstrated how Raft
can be applied to a simple database system to ensure consistency, fault tolerance, and leader
election. By applying Raft, this database system can handle client requests, replicate logs
across multiple servers, and recover gracefully from failures.

As shown, the Raft algorithm's simplicity makes it an excellent choice for building reliable
distributed databases. Whether it's a small key-value store or a large-scale distributed database,
Raft's principles help ensure that data is always consistent, even when some parts of the system
are down or unreachable. This is crucial for real-world applications that require high
availability and strong consistency, such as distributed databases, service discovery, and
cloud-native systems.
