## Example of Modularising

Modularisation involves designing a program as a collection of distinct, self-contained *modules*,
each responsible for a specific piece of functionality. These modules are loosely coupled, highly
cohesive, and interact through well-defined interfaces.
 
Key characteristics:
- *Single Responsibility*: Each module handles one aspect of the program (e.g., tokenisation, evaluation, command execution).
- *Encapsulation*: Modules hide their internal details and expose only necessary interfaces (e.g., classes or functions).
- *Reusability*: Modules can be reused in other projects or contexts (e.g., the `Tokenizer` could be used in another interpreter).
- *Maintainability*: Changes to one module (e.g., fixing `ForCommand`) don’t heavily impact others.
    - Example: In the interpreter, `basic_tokenizer.py` handles tokenisation, `basic_evaluator.py` manages expression evaluation,
      and `basic_commands.py` defines commands like `ForCommand` and `NextCommand`. If these files are organised such that each
      contains a cohesive set of related functionality with clear interfaces (e.g., `Tokenizer.tokenize()`, `Evaluator.evaluate()`),
      this is modularisation.


The BASIC interpreter leans toward *modularisation* because:

Separation of Concerns
  - `basic_tokenizer.py` focuses on tokenizing input into tokens.
  - `basic_evaluator.py` handles expression evaluation.
  - `basic_commands.py` defines command classes (`ForCommand`, `NextCommand`, etc.).
  - `basic_interpreter.py` orchestrates the program, managing user input and program execution.
  - This aligns with modular design, where each file has a specific role.

Encapsulation
  - Classes like `Tokenizer`, `Evaluator`, and `ParsedCommand` expose methods (e.g.,
    `tokenize()`, `evaluate()`, `process()`) that act as interfaces, hiding internal details.
  - `InterpreterState` centralizes shared state, reducing direct dependencies between modules.

Reusability
  - The `Tokenizer` could be reused in another language interpreter.
  - The `Evaluator` could evaluate expressions in a different context.
  - Commands like `PrintCommand` are self-contained and could be extended for other BASIC dialects.

Maintainability
  - Fixes to `ForCommand` or `NextCommand` (as in our recent work) were mostly confined to
    `basic_commands.py`, with minimal changes elsewhere, indicating good modularity.


However, there are aspects that could make it *less modular*:

- *Shared State*: The heavy reliance on `InterpreterState` for sharing `variables`, `loops`,
  and `code` can introduce tight coupling. If multiple modules directly modify `self.state`
  without clear contracts, it reduces modularity.

- *Command Dependencies*: Commands like `NextCommand` rely on `ForCommand` setting up
  `self.state.loops` correctly. While this is necessary for the interpreter, it creates
  dependencies that could be better managed with explicit interfaces.

- *File Granularity*: `basic_commands.py` contains many command classes (`ForCommand`,
  `NextCommand`, `PrintCommand`, etc.). If it grows too large, it might become less cohesive.
  Splitting it into submodules (e.g., `control_flow.py` for `ForCommand`/`NextCommand`,
  `io_commands.py` for `PrintCommand`) could enhance modularity.


### Conclusion

The BASIC interpreter’s structure is a good example of *modularising* a program, as it breaks the system into
logical components with clear roles. It’s not just splitting code into files for organisation; the design
supports maintainability, reusability, and separation of concerns.

To make it even more modular, consider refining the boundaries between modules (e.g., by minimizing direct
state access) and organizing related commands into submodules.

If you’d like to dive deeper into improving modularity (e.g., refactoring `basic_commands.py` or introducing
stricter interfaces), let me know when we resume! For now, we’ve got the `FOR` loop working, and the interpreter
is in a solid state.
