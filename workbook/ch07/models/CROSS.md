## A Cross Section in History and Evolution

In 1977, the Apple II emerged as one of the first widely available personal computers.
It was built around a MOS 6502 processor running at roughly 1 MHz and typically came with
4 to 48 KB of RAM, depending on configuration. Storage was provided by cassette tape or
floppy disks, and the machine output text and color graphics to a TV screen. It was a
self-contained, general-purpose computing system accessible to individuals--a novel idea
at the time. The Apple II cost around $1,300 to $2,600 USD (about $6,000–$12,000 today
when adjusted for inflation), putting it in reach of hobbyists, educators, and early 
usiness users. Despite its modest hardware, it could run spreadsheet software (like VisiCalc),
simple games, and even BASIC interpreters. The bottlenecks were clear: limited processing
speed, small memory, slow storage, and rudimentary displays.

Fast forward to the 2020s, and the Raspberry Pi Pico stands as an example of how dramatically
hardware has evolved. The Pico is built around the RP2040 microcontroller, a dual-core ARM
Cortex-M0+ running at 133 MHz, with 264 KB of RAM and 2 MB of flash storage. Despite being
a microcontroller--not a full general-purpose computer--the Pico surpasses the Apple II
in raw processing power, memory size, and connectivity options by orders of magnitude.
Yet it costs around $4 USD, a fraction of the Apple II’s price even before inflation
adjustments. Where the Apple II filled a desk, the Pico fits on a fingertip and consumes
minimal power. It can control robots, run real-time sensor networks, and even handle
simple graphics output with the right peripherals. Its I/O includes SPI, I2C, UART, ADCs,
and PWM, things unheard of in early personal computers.

The evolution in hardware is staggering: clock speeds have increased over 100-fold, memory
has grown by a factor of 5,000 or more, and devices have shrunk dramatically in size, weight,
and cost. Computational capabilities that once demanded expensive, bulky systems can now
be embedded into tiny, disposable hardware--because of cost.

Yet, the software story is different. In 1977, writing a compiler or operating system was a
monumental task. Compiler construction involved writing everything from scratch, including
lexical analyzers, parsers, code generators, and optimizers--often without modern conveniences
like garbage collection, rich IDEs, or even debuggers. Development was done in assembly or
rudimentary high-level languages, and testing was slow due to limited hardware. Teams of
experts took months or years to build stable compilers, with frequent iterations and painstaking
debugging.

By contrast, today's hardware, paired with modern languages, open-source libraries,
and--crucially--AI-assisted tools like Large Language Models (LLMs), has accelerated the
process dramatically. A competent programmer can, with LLM assistance, scaffold a working
compiler frontend and backend in a matter of hours or days. Tools like ANTLR, LLVM, and
modern interpreters reduce the need to hand-code every component. Even writing virtual
machines, emulators, or operating system kernels can now happen in weeks instead of years.
LLMs can instantly generate parser combinators, bytecode interpreters, and optimizer 
passes that previously took exhaustive manual effort. Documentation, examples, and
debugging advice are available on demand, something entirely absent in the late 70s.

In short, while hardware has evolved exponentially in performance, cost, and size, software
productivity improvements were comparatively incremental--until the last few years. With
especially the advent of AI-assisted programming, the rate of software development may
now catch up to the speed of hardware advancement, potentially compressing months-long
tasks into single-week projects. Where a lone Apple II hobbyist struggled to build even
simple interpreters in BASIC, a modern developer with a Raspberry Pi Pico and AI tooling
can build a cross-compiler, an RTOS, or a networked control system faster than ever before.

But, like for hardware the LLMs also stands on the shoulders of history. They didn't
learn from nothing.
