## Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralised, secure, and transparent digital ledger technology that has reshaped
how data is stored, shared, and verified across networks. It enables trust without intermediaries
by creating tamper-resistant records of transactions or data, distributed across multiple computers.
Since its inception, blockchain has evolved from a niche concept underpinning cryptocurrencies to
a transformative tool with applications spanning finance, supply chains, healthcare, and beyond.


### History in Brief

The concept of blockchain emerged in 2008 with the publication of a whitepaper by an anonymous individual
or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, titled *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*.
This introduced Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, and its underlying blockchain as a solution to the
problem of double-spending in digital currencies without relying on centralised institutions like banks.
The first Bitcoin block, known as the genesis block, was mined in January 2009, marking the birth of
blockchain in practice. While Bitcoin initially gained traction in niche tech and libertarian circles,
the broader potential of blockchain became evident by the mid-2010s. Ethereum, launched in 2015 by
Vitalik Buterin, expanded the technology’s scope by introducing smart contracts—self-executing code
stored on the blockchain—unlocking applications beyond currency. Since then, blockchain has seen waves
of innovation, from enterprise adoption by companies like IBM and JPMorgan to decentralised finance
(DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), though it has also faced scrutiny over scalability, energy
consumption, and regulatory challenges.


### The Technology

At its core, blockchain is a distributed database that records transactions in a chronological, immutable
sequence of blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions or data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic
hash of the previous block, forming a chain that is resistant to alteration. This structure ensures that
once data is added, it cannot be changed without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus
from the network—a computationally expensive and practically infeasible task in large, secure blockchains.

The technology relies on several key components. First, *decentralisation* distinguishes blockchain from
traditional databases. Instead of a central authority, data is stored across a network of nodes (computers)
that maintain identical copies of the ledger. These nodes communicate through a peer-to-peer network,
ensuring no single point of failure. Second, *consensus mechanisms* govern how nodes agree on the validity
of transactions. Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), where miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to
validate transactions and earn rewards, a process that, while secure, is energy-intensive. Ethereum and
newer blockchains often use Proof of Stake (PoS), where validators stake cryptocurrency to participate,
reducing energy use. Other mechanisms, like Delegated Proof of Stake or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance,
cater to specific needs like speed or scalability.

Cryptography underpins blockchain’s security. Transactions are signed with private-public key pairs,
ensuring only authorised parties can initiate them. Hashes—fixed-length strings generated from data—link
blocks and detect tampering. If even a single character in a block changes, its hash becomes invalid, breaking
the chain’s integrity. Additionally, *smart contracts*, pioneered by Ethereum, allow programmable logic on
the blockchain, automating agreements like payments or asset transfers when predefined conditions are met.

Blockchains can be public (permissionless, like Bitcoin, where anyone can join), private (permissioned,
restricted to authorised participants), or hybrid. Public blockchains prioritise transparency and censorship
resistance but face scalability issues, processing only a few transactions per second compared to centralised
systems like Visa. Innovations like sharding, layer-2 solutions (e.g., Lightning Network for Bitcoin), and
alternative blockchains (e.g., Solana, Polkadot) aim to address these limitations by improving throughput
and reducing costs.


### Applications

Blockchain’s applications extend far beyond cryptocurrencies. In *finance*, decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms
like Uniswap or Aave use blockchain to offer lending, borrowing, and trading without banks, relying on smart
contracts to automate processes. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the dollar, facilitate fast,
low-cost cross-border payments. In *supply chain management*, companies like Walmart use blockchain to track goods
from source to shelf, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud—IBM’s Food Trust network, for instance, traces food
products to verify authenticity and safety. *Healthcare* leverages blockchain to secure patient records, enabling
interoperable, tamper-proof data sharing while preserving privacy. *Digital identity* solutions use blockchain to
create verifiable, self-sovereign identities, reducing reliance on centralised databases vulnerable to breaches.
In the creative sector, *NFTs* enable artists to tokenise digital assets, proving ownership and authenticity, though
their speculative nature has sparked debate. Blockchain also supports *voting systems*, offering transparent, auditable
elections, and *energy markets*, where peer-to-peer trading of renewable energy is piloted in projects like Australia’s
Power Ledger.

The technology’s potential lies in its ability to eliminate intermediaries, reduce costs, and enhance trust in
systems where parties don’t inherently trust each other. However, challenges like regulatory uncertainty, high
energy consumption in some networks, and user adoption hurdles remain. As blockchain matures, its integration
with AI, IoT, and other technologies promises to unlock further innovation, making it a cornerstone of a
decentralised digital future.
