## Birbs Flying over Sea?

To move beyond simple box reflections, you could explore more game-like graphical constructions. For example,
you might simulate ocean or sea waves, then add something flying above them--whatever that may be. I’m not a
fan of weapons, conflict, or warlike themes, but of course, you may choose otherwise ..


### The Sea

A virtual 3D grid (x, z) is created, and each grid point is assigned a height (y) based on a sum of sine and cosine waves
(getWaveHeight). This simulates a heightmap-based ocean surface.

Each vertex is represented by a 3D point:

(x, y, z)

Where:
- x and z define grid positions
- y is computed as the wave height at that point.

A camera is simulated with:
- Position: camera.x, camera.y, camera.z
- Rotation: camera.rotX (pitch), camera.rotY (yaw)
- Perspective field of view: camera.fov

This allows interactive rotation and zooming.

Manual 3D to 2D projection is done in project3D(x, y, z) using:
- Rotation matrices for camera pitch and yaw
- Perspective projection based on camera FOV and depth z:

```javascript
const scale = this.camera.fov / z;
const screenX = x * scale + this.width / 2;
const screenY = y * scale + this.height / 2;
```

This converts the 3D points to 2D canvas coordinates.

The surface is dynamically computed each frame using:
- Multiple harmonics in getWaveHeight(...) for realism
- Different parameters: amplitude, frequency, speed, complexity

This gives the illusion of a dynamic 3D ocean surface with undulating waves.

Although not implemented directly, this.fogDistance suggests a visual fading or darkening
of distant points, mimicking atmospheric fog for depth perception.


### A Birb Flying

An unidentified object is flying over the ocean.

The core transformation from 3D to 2D screen space is performed manually. Each 3D point (x, y, z) is projected
onto the canvas using a simplified perspective projection:

```javascript
const fov = 500;
const scale = fov / (fov + z);
const sx = x * scale + this.cx;
const sy = y * scale + this.cy;
```

- This mimics a pinhole camera model.
- The fov value acts like a focal length.
- Depth (z) controls the scaling factor: the further back in space, the smaller the projected size.
- cx and cy represent the camera’s screen-space center.

This is a non-matrix-based perspective projection—minimal but functionally equivalent to the standard
P = (x/z, y/z) scaled to screen.


Before projection, all world-space points are rotated using 3D Euler angles (rotX, rotY) to simulate camera orientation:

```javascript
// Yaw rotation (around Y axis)
const rx = Math.cos(rotY) * px - Math.sin(rotY) * pz;
const rz = Math.sin(rotY) * px + Math.cos(rotY) * pz;

// Pitch rotation (around X axis)
const ry = Math.cos(rotX) * py - Math.sin(rotX) * rz;
const z2 = Math.sin(rotX) * py + Math.cos(rotX) * rz;
```

This simulates a camera orbiting around the scene:
- rotY simulates horizontal camera rotation (left-right).
- rotX simulates vertical tilt (up-down).
- There is no roll; the up vector remains vertical.

This is a basic version of the rotation part of a view matrix, using manual cosine/sine calculations.

Each point in the world is translated relative to the camera before applying projection:

```javascript
let px = x - this.cam.x;
let py = y - this.cam.y;
let pz = z - this.cam.z;
```

This is analogous to the view matrix translation stage in standard 3D graphics pipelines.

Combined with rotation and projection, this provides a full camera transformation chain:
World → Camera Space → Clip Space → Screen


Simulated depth fog is applied based on distance from the camera:

```javascript
const depth = z2;
ctx.fillStyle = `rgba(0, 100, 200, ${Math.max(0, 1 - depth / 200)})`;
```

- Objects farther from the camera become more transparent (fade into background).
- This visually reinforces depth without z-buffering.
- Equivalent to a linear fog function:
  fogFactor = clamp(1 - z / maxZ, 0, 1)

This is a post-projection, per-point alpha attenuation.


The ocean is represented as a mesh grid in the XZ-plane (Y = height), with each point displaced
in Y using a wave function.

```javascript
const y = waveFunction(x, z, time);
```

- Conceptually, this is a heightmap:
  y = f(x, z)
- The grid is dense enough to appear smooth but is entirely procedural (no vertex buffers or indices).
- The grid is rendered as quads:
- Four adjacent projected points form one quadrilateral patch.
- Drawn using 2D ctx.beginPath() / ctx.lineTo().

This mimics a vertex shader + rasterization cycle in a 3D renderer, manually executed.



There is no z-buffer. Instead:
- Grid rows are rendered from back to front (larger z to smaller z).
- Ensures that more distant rows are drawn before nearer ones.

```javascript
for (let z = gridDepth; z >= 0; z--) {
  for (let x = 0; x <= gridWidth; x++) {
    // draw quad
  }
}
```

This is a primitive painter’s algorithm, suitable because the mesh is regular and continuous.
Occlusion is visually correct under these constraints.


The birb (a.k.a. bird) is represented as a 3D object with (x, y, z) position and is independently
projected into screen space using the same camera transformation logic.
- It follows a world-space path (Math.sin(t), cos(t), etc).
- Rotation/tilt is used to affect orientation or wing flap (simplified animation).
- No lighting or shading is applied; only position and size vary with depth.

This corresponds to a sprite billboard projected into 3D space, much like old-school 3D games.



Although not true lighting, visual depth cues are enhanced with:
- Flat shading via blue-gray color scaling.
- The fog gradient functions as an ambient occlusion approximation.

There is no normal vector, no directional lighting, and no shading model—just color based on position or altitude.

### Heavy Duck-Bird Flying Over Ocean

The code is scaffolding for an interactive 3D-like ocean simulation with a bird flying over it. While it
uses 2D canvas rendering (<canvas> with getContext("2d")), it creates the illusion of a 3D scene using
manual projection, camera rotation, and perspective techniques—a form of software-based 3D rendering.

- *Concept:* The camera defines a point of view in 3D space, and perspective projection is used to map 3D
  coordinates to 2D screen space.
- Code:
```javascript
this.camera = {
    x: 0,
    y: 5,
    z: -15,
    rotX: -0.3,
    rotY: 0,
    fov: 800
};
```
- rotX, rotY: Pitch and yaw for rotating the camera.
- z: Distance from the camera to the scene.
- fov: Used to scale 3D points to 2D (manual perspective projection expected later in rendering).

- *Concept:* Objects and the camera are moved or rotated in 3D space. These transformations help simulate a 3D world.
- Code: While matrix math is not shown here, the code later uses rotX and rotY to rotate the camera view using mouse input:
```javascript
this.camera.rotY += deltaX * 0.01;
this.camera.rotX += deltaY * 0.01;
```


- *Concept:* Geometry (like a wave mesh) is generated dynamically rather than pre-defined. Often used in terrain
  and fluid simulations.
- Code:
```javascript
this.gridSize = 80;
this.waveParams = { amplitude, frequency, speed, complexity };
```
This suggests that an 80×80 grid will be procedurally displaced based on a wave function, which likely depends on
time, position, and wave parameters.


- *Concept:* The bird’s flight path and wing flap are animated using functions of time.
- Code:
```javascript
this.bird = {
    ...
    wingFlap: 0,
    wingFrequency: 0.3,
    speed: 1.5,
    ...
};
```
Wing flapping and possibly gliding are implemented as sine functions or similar. The bird’s movement is animated in 3D space.

- *Concept:* Camera movement and scene rotation by the user simulate interaction within a 3D world.
- Code:
  - Mouse drag: changes rotX/rotY for rotating the view.
	- Mouse scroll: zooms by moving the camera along Z.
	- Arrow keys: allow manual bird flight.


- *Concept:* Not true lighting, but fog and depth-based effects simulate atmospheric perspective.
- Code:
```javascript
this.fogDistance = 30;
```
Points farther from the camera may be faded or color-shifted to simulate fog.



- *Concept:* The bird moves with a velocity vector, possibly affected by acceleration, altitude, and heading.
- Code:
```javascript
this.bird.velocityX, velocityY, velocityZ
this.bird.pitch, roll, tilt
```
These variables will be updated to move the bird and change its orientation in space.


- *Concept:* Live-tunable controls to affect waveforms and flight dynamics—similar to shader or simulation parameters.
- Code:
```javascript
<input type="range" id="amplitude">
<input type="range" id="speed">
<input type="range" id="birdHeight">
```
These inputs alter simulation values in real time, affecting the visual 3D output.
