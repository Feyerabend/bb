* Geometric: computational geometry tasks like convex hull, intersection detection, Voronoi diagrams ..
* Numerical: to solve numerical problems such as solving equations, numerical integration, matrix operations (e.g., Gaussian elimination, FFT)
* Cryptographic: to secure data and communications (e.g., RSA, AES, hash functions)
