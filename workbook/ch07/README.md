## The Mechanics

This repository presents a curated collection of software engineering patterns, language interpreters,
concurrency models, and systems-level components. Rather than offering a set of disconnected code samples,
the repository functions as both a practical reference and an educational resource, combining theoretical
depth with concrete implementation examples.

At its core, it demonstrates a wide range of design patterns, including classic structures such as Decorator,
Adapter, and Command, as well as more intricate patterns like Composite, Visitor, and Facade. These are
implemented in various programming languages and, in many cases, paired with graphical user interface examples
to illustrate real-world usage. The implementations emphasise not only functional correctness but also hopefully
the pedagogical clarity needed for developers looking to deeply understand pattern mechanics.

In parallel, the repository explores programming language design and implementation across several paradigms
(also here called "models"). It includes interpreters for array-oriented languages inspired by APL and K,
functional languages in the Lisp family, and imperative models modeled after BASIC and Fortran. Object-oriented
approaches are represented through small systems written in Java and Python, while stack-based and concatenative
models, including a working Forth interpreter, round out the language variety.

A significant portion of the repository is dedicated to concurrency and parallelism. It provides working
implementations of thread synchronisation constructs such as mutexes and semaphores, and includes classic
problems like the dining philosophers and producer-consumer coordination. Other models, as Communicating
Sequential Processes (CSP), are also explored, along with practical examples of parallel computation such
as π estimation through distributed algorithms.

Computer graphics is another major focus. The repository features 3D rendering pipelines, vector graphics
engines, and visualisation frameworks built on technologies like WebGL and SVG. These projects emphasise
not only the mechanics of rendering but also the structure of modular, reusable graphics code.

From a foundational computer science perspective, the repository includes a diverse set of data structures
and algorithms. This includes advanced tree implementations (red-black, AVL, splay), graph algorithms
(e.g., Dijkstra's and Prim's), and specialized structures like Bloom filters and Fenwick trees. It also
addresses low-level topics like manual memory management and allocation strategies.

The systems programming section is particularly rich, featuring working implementations of context switching,
coroutines, event loops, and dynamic dispatch. These components are essential for understanding the mechanics
of virtual machines, interpreters, and runtime environments.

Networking is also addressed through web server implementations, RPC frameworks, and distributed systems
components such as a Raft consensus algorithm. These projects highlight architectural patterns in client-server
design and offer insight into communication protocols and fault tolerance.

Across all domains, the repository is distinguished by its multi-paradigm approach and cross-language breadth,
with projects written in C, Python, and JavaScript. Emphasis is placed on visualisation and demonstration,
making complex systems and algorithms easier to explore and understand. Many projects are accompanied by
documentation and tutorials, reinforcing the repository’s dual role as a learning platform and technical reference.

Taken as a whole, this collection demonstrates a consistent commitment to clarity, completeness, and educational
value. It includes fully functional miniature systems and patterns, making it an ideal resource for anyone
interested in the internal workings of software systems, programming languages, and architectural design.

Yet, we can only touch the surface of what is an extraordinarily deep and expansive area.
