# From Basics To Bytecode: A guide to computers and programming
# Workbook


ideas?
- more on security
- legacy
- refactor




samples of thinking
- 60s/70s flow charts -> code
- (80s)90s crc -> code
- now -> prototype code in AI -> code


other?
* Geometric: computational geometry tasks like convex hull, intersection detection, Voronoi diagrams ..
* Numerical: to solve numerical problems such as solving equations, numerical integration, matrix operations (e.g., Gaussian elimination, FFT)
* Cryptographic: to secure data and communications (e.g., RSA, AES, hash functions)
