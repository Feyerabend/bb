## The Web

*This section explores some emerging technologies within a broader historical and societal context,
emphasising how technology evolves in relation to its use. In the case of the web, this relationship
proved transformative, with the medium not only enabling new forms of communication and organisation
but also reshaping society itself in profound and lasting ways. These entanglements between
technology and society will be examined further in the next chapter [ch08](./../../../../ch08/).
Looking ahead, the next wave of influential technology--already beginning to take shape--is
artificial intelligence, which may come to define a new era of probably even greater significance.*


The early web emerged from a vision of openness, simplicity, and universal accessibility. At its core,
it was built around the idea of linking knowledge: documents connected to other documents through hyperlinks,
creating a vast and navigable network of information. This idea was not just technical--it was deeply
"philosophical." It meant that any person with a basic connection and a browser could follow paths across
ideas, publications, and conversations. There was no central authority or gatekeeper controlling the flow;
instead, the protocols that powered it were decentralised and public.

The foundational principles were transparency and minimalism. HTTP, the protocol for transferring documents,
was plain-text, human-readable, and designed to be inspectable and educational. HTML, the markup language,
was similarly modest—structuring text rather than formatting it heavily. These formats invited learning by
doing; anyone could "view source" and understand, replicate, and build upon what they saw. This was *not* a
closed or proprietary world, but one that encouraged curiosity and tinkering.

Another defining feature was the separation of concerns. Servers stored content, browsers rendered it, and
the protocol governed their communication. This division made it possible to improve each piece independently
and encouraged interoperability. The goal was not to deliver applications but to deliver documents, and to
do so reliably over any kind of connection or machine. That's why early web pages were mostly static, made
up of headers, paragraphs, lists, and links--a digital form of publishing rather than programming.

The *stateless* nature of HTTP also reflected this simplicity. Each request was independent; the server did
not need to remember anything about the client. This lack of memory kept the system lean and robust, though
it later required workarounds like cookies and sessions when more dynamic interaction became necessary.

Navigation itself was democratised. The "Back" and "Forward" buttons of browsers captured the essence of
user agency. You weren’t locked into a flow or experience; you could explore, retrace your steps, and choose
your path freely. The browser was not just a window, but a tool for traversing a conceptual landscape.

In short, the [early web](./HISTORY.md) rested on the idea that knowledge should be shared in an open,
simple, and interoperable way. It prioritised documents over programs, links over silos, and understanding
over abstraction. This is what made it revolutionary not just as a technology, but as a public good.

Also, the early days of the web was guided largely by open standards and collaborative efforts. Key
protocols like HTTP and formats like HTML were documented in RFCs (Requests for Comments), a system
originally developed for the broader internet community under the IETF (not only the web). At the same time,
the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 to coordinate the development of web standards
in a more structured and vendor-neutral way. Early web technologies emphasised simplicity and openness,
focusing on interoperability and human-readable markup, with HTML 2.0 (1995) being one of the first
formalised versions reflecting the consensus of that era.

But we also had much fun--even in the standards. One of the most well-known HTTP status codes is 404
Not Found, returned when a page is missing. However, not all codes were entirely serious. For example,
RFC 2324, written as an April Fools' joke in 1998, defined the HTTP status code [418](teapot.png)
I'm a teapot, to be returned by teapots that receive requests to brew coffee[^418]. While never intended
for real-world use, it became a beloved easter egg in web culture. These kinds of whimsical additions
reflected the playful and collaborative spirit of the early web community, where experimentation,
humour, and openness were just as important as the technical progress.

### Misled? Personal Reflections

*In a way we were led to believe that the future of Internet also could be in the philosophy of these
properties. Cf. some of my contemporary opinions in 1995 reflected in a [portrait](./PORTRAIT.md) of me.*

The idea was that *decentralisation*, *openness*, and *transparency* would not just be technical features--they
would be social principles embedded in the very structure of digital society. Protocols, not platforms, were
supposed to shape the flow of information. Identity would be distributed, privacy would be the default,
and no single entity would be able to exert total control over communication.

For a while, that vision guided many of the early projects and communities: peer-to-peer networks, free
software, federated protocols like XMPP and later ActivityPub. The architecture mirrored the ethics.
And perhaps that's why many feels the disappointment so acute today.

As the commercial web consolidated into a few dominant platforms, the underlying philosophy shifted.
Centralisation became more efficient. Convenience replaced autonomy. Closed ecosystems outcompeted open
standards--not because they were better for the users, but because they better served the logic of capital
and data accumulation.

Still, the original philosophy didn’t vanish. It survives in niche communities.
Maybe the future of the Internet lies not in inventing something entirely different, but in rediscovering
and updating those foundational principles. Not out of nostalgia, but because the problems we face now
are the problems they were trying to solve all along.
