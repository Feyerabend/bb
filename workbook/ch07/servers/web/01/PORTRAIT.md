## Online Philosopher

#### Portrait

*Name:* Set Lonnert  
*Occupation:* Philosopher and soon-to-be doctoral student in the history of science. Avid IT user.  
*Age:* 32 years.  
*Resides:* Uppsala.

### WHAT DOES SET LONNERT THINK ABOUT:

*Computer magazines?*  
- Both "concrete" and "abstract" magazines are needed. Technical depth is, of course, a must,
  but only recently have magazines started addressing the people alongside the technology.

*CyberCity (Svenska Dagbladet's BBS)?*  
- The local feel of CyberCity (CC) allows people to get to know each other. On the Internet,
  people usually connect over shared interests. On CC, you engage in multiple matters, express
  opinions on various topics, and thus get to know each other as personalities.

*AI (Artificial Intelligence)?*  
- Today, AI faces "competition" from fields like cognitive research. AI seems to be moving away
  from its earlier, rather focused research on technology to consider both people and technology.

*When did you first try computer communication?*  
- It was at an exhibition about the history and future of telephony at the Technical Museum in
  Stockholm. A computer terminal (Texas Instrument) was connected to a computer at KTH. I was
  about 15 years old and felt exhilarated by the possibility of manipulating a computer in
  another geographical location.

*How do you view the relationship between technology and culture?*  
- When I came to Uppsala University in 1982 to study theoretical philosophy, I had the absurd
  idea of combining philosophy with computer technology. Now, I've broadened my perspective and
  believe that the humanities have connection points with IT (information technology), but they
  are hard to discover and cultivate. I think one must view IT, society, and culture in a
  balanced way. It's a game with many variables.

*How do you use the Internet?*  
- I mostly use the Internet for email. It's a powerful tool that reduces the significance of
  academic hierarchies. The matter, the question, the discussion is what's essential. Rank,
  status, or external attributes are pushed to the background.

*What do you think IT will look like in the future?*  
- Tomorrow's IT will primarily be fast and high-capacity. IT is now society's new engine,
  evident in how people communicate over long distances via computers. If it were just
  computers communicating to solve massive computational problems, like for the universe,
  we wouldn't have IT as we know it.

*What are your favorite spots on the Internet?*  
- It's not really a place but a service I choose: mailing lists. The information comes to
  you--you don't need to seek it out. You can ask questions, get answers, participate in
  conversations, or just listen. Mailing lists are like correspondence but in an expanded
  form, while web pages are like magazines or journals. You have to browse a long time on
  the WWW to find the right thing. That said, the Yahoo search engine is a pleasant spot.
