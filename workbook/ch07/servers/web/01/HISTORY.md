## The Development of the Web from 1989-1997

*The Web spread slowly at the beginning of the 1990s. At university libraries in Sweden, you could
access Gopher, a text-based hierarchical system for navigating information hierarchies. Librarians
loved hierarchy. It let you browse library catalogues and access a range of public documents, and
it felt like a revelation at the time. When I got my own internet connection in 1994, Gopher was
still widespread. Clients were easy to download and install, and they ran well even on the kind
of simple--read: cheap--hardware that a student with limited cash flow could afford.*

*The Web was just beginning to make its presence felt. There were a few early websites, some by
enthusiasts like myself, but many people still didn't quite know what the Web was or how it differed
from Gopher. Early web clients like Lynx (text-only) could run on low-end machines, and graphical
browsers like Mosaic were just barely within reach for those of us with enough RAM and a decent modem.*

*This was all about to change .. and rapidly.*


### 1989–1991: Conception and Birth

Let's back up. The story of the Web begins in *1989*, when *Tim Berners-Lee*, a British computer scientist
working at CERN, proposed a system for managing and linking information using hypertext. His idea was to
enable researchers to access and connect documents easily across different systems. This project, originally
described as "a large hypertext database with typed links," would evolve into the *World Wide Web*.

By *1990*, Berners-Lee had written the first web browser and editor (initially called WorldWideWeb, later
renamed Nexus), the first web server (httpd), and the very first web page, which went live at `info.cern.ch`.
Alongside the software, he defined the core components of the Web: *HTML* (the markup language for documents),
*HTTP* (the protocol for transferring them), and *URLs* (a uniform way to identify them).

This was very much in the tradition of the Internet's protocol-driven architecture. Just as we had NNTP for
Usenet news, SMTP and POP for email, FTP for file transfers, here was a new protocol stack tailored for
hypertext. But what set Berners-Lee's system apart wasn't just the technology--it was the elegance of the
integration. The Web didn't try to replace other protocols; it quietly layered itself over the existing
Internet, tying things together rather than reinventing them.

Gopher, created at the University of Minnesota in 1991, was another protocol--a menu-based system for
navigating distributed documents. Gopher did support hyperlinks of a kind. Its model allowed entries to
point to documents, services, or even other Gopher servers, creating a tree-like structure of connected
content. In that sense, Gopher was "linked," but it lacked the free-form, inline hypertext of HTML--the
ability to embed a link within a paragraph, to shape a document as a web of meaning rather than a
hierarchy of menus.

In *1991*, Berners-Lee released the Web to the public. Initially, it was confined to the academic and research
communities, running mostly on NeXT workstations, but it set the stage for something much bigger.


### 1992–1993: Spreading Beyond Academia

As interest grew, new browsers began to appear. The *Line Mode Browser* was developed to provide broader
access across various systems, especially those without graphical interfaces. Other graphical browsers
like *ViolaWWW* began to emerge, offering early attempts at combining usability with hypertext navigation.
However, the Web was still niche, mostly text-based, and far from mainstream.


### 1993: The Mosaic Revolution

Everything changed in *1993* with the release of *Mosaic*, a new graphical web browser developed by
*Marc Andreessen* and *Eric Bina* at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) in
Illinois. Mosaic was groundbreaking because it could display text and images in the same window and
ran on multiple platforms, including Windows, which opened the Web to a much broader audience. Mosaic
became the first browser to gain significant traction outside academia, and it is often credited with
igniting the *Web boom*.

*Importantly, early web browsers recognised Gopher as part of the larger ecosystem. Mosaic, for example,
supported multiple protocols: HTTP, FTP, Gopher, and even NNTP. It wasn't uncommon to see Gopher URLs
linked from early web pages, and some early web content mirrored Gopher resources. This interoperability
was part of the Web's early appeal--it didn't try to replace everything outright, but instead absorbed
what came before, offering a more flexible, document-centric alternative. You could browse a Gopher
directory, open an FTP link, or click a hypertext anchor--all in the same interface.*

*In practice, it meant that any document, no matter where it lived--be it a research paper on a university
FTP server or a plain-text FAQ in a Gopher directory--could, in principle, be linked and accessed via the
same browser interface. It unified access to information and gave people, not just institutions, a way to
publish and interconnect content globally. The simplicity of the design was key.*

*The early Web practiced a form of technological syncretism--layering itself atop older systems like
Gopher and FTP, not erasing them, but incorporating them into a new, more flexible structure.*


### 1994: Commercialisation and Netscape

Recognising the potential of the Web, Marc Andreessen left NCSA and co-founded Mosaic Communications
Corporation, later renamed *Netscape Communications*. That year, the company released *Netscape Navigator 1.0*,
a sleek and fast browser that quickly became dominant in the emerging browser market. Navigator's ease of
use and platform compatibility helped drive massive adoption of the Web.

Meanwhile, Tim Berners-Lee launched the *World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)* at MIT in *1994*. The W3C became
the central standards body for web technologies, aiming to ensure that the Web remained open and interoperable.
With backing from CERN, MIT, and eventually INRIA in France, the W3C began working on formalising web protocols
and markup languages.


### 1995: The Web Goes Mainstream

By *1995*, the Web had entered the public consciousness. Netscape Navigator held the lion's share of the
browser market, and the number of websites exploded. Microsoft, seeing the growing importance of the Web,
released *Internet Explorer 1.0* as part of the Windows 95 Plus! Pack. This marked the beginning of what
would become the *browser wars*.

In the same year, *HTML 2.0* was released by the IETF as the first standardised version of the language.
Web content began to include forms, basic styling, and rudimentary scripting through CGI scripts. The idea
of dynamic content--pages that changed based on user interaction--started to take shape.


### 1996: Browser Wars Begin

With the Web's rapid commercialisation, competition intensified. Netscape released newer versions of Navigator
with proprietary enhancements, while Microsoft responded with aggressive development of Internet Explorer.
*IE 3.0*, released in *1996*, introduced significant improvements, including support for
*Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)*, plug-ins, ActiveX, and a new scripting language called JavaScript.

*JavaScript*, created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, quickly became a standard tool for adding interactivity
to web pages. This period saw a flood of browser-specific features as companies raced to outdo each other.
As a result, websites often behaved differently depending on the browser, and developers were forced to
write code with conditional logic to handle these inconsistencies.


### 1997: Stabilisation and Standards Push

By *1997*, the need for standardisation was widely acknowledged. The W3C finalised *HTML 3.2*, which codified
many of the de facto features that had appeared during the rapid growth of the Web. Work also began on
*HTML 4.0*, which was released later that year and introduced improvements in scripting support, accessibility,
and separation of content and presentation.

*CSS1*, first introduced by the W3C in *1996*, was starting to gain traction among developers who wanted
better control over layout and style without cluttering HTML with formatting tags. Meanwhile, Microsoft
released *Internet Explorer 4.0*, continuing its aggressive push into the market and eroding Netscape's
dominance.

At this point, the Web had transformed from a research project into a global communication medium. It had a
growing set of standards, a commercial ecosystem, and a rapidly expanding base of users, developers,
and businesses.
