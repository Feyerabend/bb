## The Development of the Web from 1998 to 2000

In the early 1990s, the World Wide Web was expanding at an extraordinary pace, but unlike
structured systems like Gopher, the web was a sprawling, unindexed wilderness. As websites
multiplied, users found themselves adrift in an ever-growing sea of pages, desperate for
better ways to navigate. This growing chaos gave rise to the first attempts to impose order
on the web, beginning with human-guided directories before giving way to the raw power of
automated search engines.  

Yahoo!, founded in January 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo, began as a simple list of
websites curated by hand. Originally called *"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web,"*
it was a labor of love, a way for its creators to keep track of their favourite online resources.
But as the web exploded in size, so did Yahoo’s ambitions. It transformed into a full-fledged
directory, relying on human editors to sort websites into categories, offering users a
structured way to explore the web before algorithms could do the job. For a time, Yahoo
was not just a search tool--it was a portal, a homepage, a gateway to the internet itself.  

But the limitations of human curation soon became apparent. The web was growing too fast for
any team of editors to keep up. Enter AltaVista, launched in December 1995 by Digital Equipment
Corporation. Unlike Yahoo, AltaVista was a true search engine, powered by automated crawlers
that scoured the web at an unprecedented scale. It was fast, comprehensive, and shockingly
advanced for its time. Users could type natural language queries, refine searches with Boolean
operators, and even hunt for images and videos—features that felt revolutionary in an era
when most search tools were rudimentary at best. For a few golden years, AltaVista was the
king of search, the place where the internet seemed most navigable.  

Yet the late 1990s brought a deeper transformation, one that would reshape the web from an
open, experimental playground into a commercialised, algorithm-driven machine. Between 1998
and 2000, the web shed much of its early idealism. Community-driven projects like the Open
Directory Project, which relied on volunteers to catalog the web, struggled to compete with
profit-seeking portals. Yahoo, once a humble directory, became a media giant, while upstarts
like Google--founded in 1998--introduced radical new approaches to search, ranking pages
not just by keywords but by their connections, their authority, their place in the web’s
hidden architecture. The dot-com boom poured money into the internet, accelerating its
evolution from a niche tool into a global necessity.  

By the turn of the millennium, the web had changed irrevocably. Human-curated directories
were fading relics. Search was no longer about browsing categories but about typing a
question and trusting an algorithm to deliver the answer. The early web’s anarchic spirit
still lingered, but the age of automation had arrived--and there was no going back.  

Meanwhile, the concept of the "free" web—where access to content and services was open and
often community-driven—started to erode. The late 1990s saw rapid commercialisation.
Businesses recognised the web’s enormous potential and began investing heavily in online
presence and advertising. The dot-com boom led to an explosion of startups, many aiming
to monetise traffic and data. Advertising models evolved, with banner ads and pay-per-click
becoming primary revenue sources. This commercialisation brought increased capital and
innovation but also introduced proprietary platforms, gated content, and concerns about
privacy and access.

Technology developments accelerated alongside this commercialisation. The rise of faster
Internet connections, improved browsers (notably Internet Explorer and Netscape), and new
standards like HTML 4.01 and CSS allowed richer, more interactive websites. Web technologies
began to support multimedia, scripting (JavaScript), and dynamic content, laying the
groundwork for Web 2.0’s interactivity in the following decade. Server-side technologies
and databases grew more sophisticated, enabling personalised and transaction-based websites.

In summary, the 1998–2000 period was pivotal: it witnessed Google’s rise as the dominant
search engine, the decline of human-curated directories like ODP, rapid commercialisation
of the web, and significant technological advances. These changes transformed the Internet
from a decentralised, open space into a highly commercialised, complex infrastructure that
balanced innovation with emerging challenges around openness, privacy, and control.


### Other Technological Developments

The late 1990s weren’t just about search engines--they marked a seismic shift in how the
web functioned, monetised, and interacted with users. Pay-per-click advertising, pioneered
by GoTo.com (later Overture), redefined online revenue by tying profits directly to user
behaviour. This model was so effective that Google adapted it into AdWords (2000), transforming
search engines from mere tools into economic powerhouses. Suddenly, every query became a
potential transaction, embedding commerce into the fabric of the web itself.

On the client side, browsers grew more dynamic. Advances in JavaScript, CSS, and DOM manipulation
laid the groundwork for interactive web applications--though full AJAX-style responsiveness
wouldn’t arrive until the 2000s. Meanwhile, plugins like Flash and Java applets filled the gaps,
enabling animations, games, and even rudimentary web apps. These technologies made the web
feel less like a static library and more like a space for experimentation, paving the way
for the rich interfaces of the future.

Connectivity was accelerating, too. Broadband, though still limited to early adopters,
began creeping into homes, while improved dial-up compression (like ISDN) squeezed faster
speeds from existing infrastructure. This incremental boost allowed media--heavy
designs--banner ads, streaming audio, even early video--to proliferate, making the web
more visually persuasive and commercially viable.

Behind the scenes, e-commerce infrastructure matured decisively. SSL encryption became
standard, securing credit card transactions, while backend databases and payment gateways
(like PayPal, founded 1998) streamlined online purchases. Platforms like Amazon and eBay
no longer felt like novelties but inevitabilities, as the web shed its academic skin
and embraced its role as a global marketplace.

The dot-com bubble’s frenzy obscured the real legacy of this era: the web wasn’t just
commercialised--it was industrialised, with standardised monetisation, interactivity,
and logistics. By 2000, the scaffolding for the modern internet was firmly in place.

These technological developments collectively shifted the web from a largely open,
experimental, and academic space to a commercialised, algorithm-driven, and increasingly
centralised ecosystem--a trend that would only intensify in the following decades.


### After 2000?

The dot-com crash fundamentally reshaped the trajectory of the Internet. In the late 1990s,
speculative investment had fueled a wave of startups with little more than vague promises
and flashy domain names. Many of these companies lacked working products, revenue models,
or long-term strategies. Yet, thanks to an overheated venture capital environment and a
media narrative that portrayed the Internet as a gold rush, they attracted massive funding
and launched ambitious, often unsustainable services.

When the crash hit around 2000–2001, the NASDAQ collapsed, and thousands of these companies
folded almost overnight. The exuberance vanished, and what remained was a more sober and
cautious approach to the Internet. Businesses that survived were forced to prove their
economic viability. Simply having a website was no longer impressive--investors and users
began to demand performance, stability, and actual value.

This sudden downturn cleared out the noise and hype, but it also led to a kind of consolidation.
Larger, more technically grounded companies like Amazon and eBay adapted and grew, while
emerging players like Google benefited from the vacuum left behind. The collapse of many
free, idealistic projects made room for business models that were more pragmatic: ad-driven
services, pay-per-use systems, and eventually subscription-based models.

Technologically, this period drove a shift toward scalable, robust infrastructure. Instead
of flashy web experiments, focus turned to databases, server architecture, security, and
performance. At the same time, the idea of the open, peer-to-peer web that had characterised
the early 1990s began to fade. What replaced it was a more centralised Internet, increasingly
dominated by a few powerful actors who had both the technological expertise and financial
resources to survive the fallout.

Culturally, the crash marked a turning point. It ended the naive optimism that had imagined
the web as an open utopia and replaced it with a sense of caution and commercial realism.
The dream of a decentralised, democratic Internet gave way to the rise of platforms, data-driven
services, and an emerging awareness of the costs--economic, political, and personal--of
living in a connected world.

In retrospect, the dot-com crash can be seen as the end of the Internet’s adolescence. It
forced a reckoning with reality, but also laid the groundwork for the platforms, tools, and
services that would define the next phase of the web--less freewheeling, but far more stable
and far-reaching.
