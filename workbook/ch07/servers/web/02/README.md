## The Development of the Web from 1998 to 2000

In the early 1990s, the World Wide Web was expanding at an extraordinary pace, but unlike
structured systems like Gopher, the web was a sprawling, unindexed wilderness. As websites
multiplied, users found themselves adrift in an ever-growing sea of pages, desperate for
better ways to navigate. This growing chaos gave rise to the first attempts to impose order
on the web, beginning with human-guided directories before giving way to the raw power of
automated search engines.  

Yahoo!, founded in January 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo, began as a simple list of
websites curated by hand. Originally called *"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web,"*
it was a labor of love, a way for its creators to keep track of their favorite online resources.
But as the web exploded in size, so did Yahoo’s ambitions. It transformed into a full-fledged
directory, relying on human editors to sort websites into categories, offering users a
structured way to explore the web before algorithms could do the job. For a time, Yahoo
was not just a search tool--it was a portal, a homepage, a gateway to the internet itself.  

But the limitations of human curation soon became apparent. The web was growing too fast for
any team of editors to keep up. Enter AltaVista, launched in December 1995 by Digital Equipment
Corporation. Unlike Yahoo, AltaVista was a true search engine, powered by automated crawlers
that scoured the web at an unprecedented scale. It was fast, comprehensive, and shockingly
advanced for its time. Users could type natural language queries, refine searches with Boolean
operators, and even hunt for images and videos—features that felt revolutionary in an era
when most search tools were rudimentary at best. For a few golden years, AltaVista was the
king of search, the place where the internet seemed most navigable.  

Yet the late 1990s brought a deeper transformation, one that would reshape the web from an
open, experimental playground into a commercialized, algorithm-driven machine. Between 1998
and 2000, the web shed much of its early idealism. Community-driven projects like the Open
Directory Project, which relied on volunteers to catalog the web, struggled to compete with
profit-seeking portals. Yahoo, once a humble directory, became a media giant, while upstarts
like Google--founded in 1998--introduced radical new approaches to search, ranking pages
not just by keywords but by their connections, their authority, their place in the web’s
hidden architecture. The dot-com boom poured money into the internet, accelerating its
evolution from a niche tool into a global necessity.  

By the turn of the millennium, the web had changed irrevocably. Human-curated directories
were fading relics. Search was no longer about browsing categories but about typing a
question and trusting an algorithm to deliver the answer. The early web’s anarchic spirit
still lingered, but the age of automation had arrived--and there was no going back.  

Meanwhile, the concept of the "free" web—where access to content and services was open and
often community-driven—started to erode. The late 1990s saw rapid commercialization.
Businesses recognized the web’s enormous potential and began investing heavily in online
presence and advertising. The dot-com boom led to an explosion of startups, many aiming
to monetize traffic and data. Advertising models evolved, with banner ads and pay-per-click
becoming primary revenue sources. This commercialization brought increased capital and
innovation but also introduced proprietary platforms, gated content, and concerns about
privacy and access.

Technology developments accelerated alongside this commercialization. The rise of faster
Internet connections, improved browsers (notably Internet Explorer and Netscape), and new
standards like HTML 4.01 and CSS allowed richer, more interactive websites. Web technologies
began to support multimedia, scripting (JavaScript), and dynamic content, laying the
groundwork for Web 2.0’s interactivity in the following decade. Server-side technologies
and databases grew more sophisticated, enabling personalized and transaction-based websites.

In summary, the 1998–2000 period was pivotal: it witnessed Google’s rise as the dominant
search engine, the decline of human-curated directories like ODP, rapid commercialization
of the web, and significant technological advances. These changes transformed the Internet
from a decentralized, open space into a highly commercialized, complex infrastructure that
balanced innovation with emerging challenges around openness, privacy, and control.


### Other Techological Developments

* Web Monetisation Models
    - Pay-per-click advertising, pioneered by services like GoTo.com (later Overture),
      created a new commercial model for search.
    - Google later adapted this into AdWords (launched 2000), turning search itself
      into a profitable commercial infrastructure.

* Client-Side and Browser Capabilities
    - The late 1990s saw improvements in JavaScript, CSS, and DOM manipulation, which
      enabled more interactive web applications.
    - While not as advanced as later AJAX technologies, these developments set the
      stage for dynamic and commercial web experiences.

* Increased Bandwidth and Connectivity
    - The spread of broadband in certain markets and better dial-up speeds globally
      made richer content more accessible.
    - This encouraged media-heavy sites, advertising platforms, and e-commerce to
      flourish.

* E-Commerce Infrastructure
    - Payment systems, SSL encryption, and backend technologies matured enough to
      support secure and scalable online transactions.
    - This made services like Amazon, eBay, and various dot-com startups viable,
      further pushing the commercialization of the web.

These technological developments collectively shifted the web from a largely open,
experimental, and academic space to a commercialised, algorithm-driven, and increasingly
centralised ecosystem--a trend that would only intensify in the following decades.
