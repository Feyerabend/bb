## "Object Browsing"?

One idea--certainly not unique to me--is that traditional web browsers might soon face competition from what we might call object browsers. The basic notion is that in the near future, objects could become the primary units of information transmitted across networks (the Internet, or even Intranets and Extranets). Today’s web is document-based, but there are good reasons to think that documents may soon be challenged by the rise of networked objects.

That said, there are equally strong reasons to believe that documents will persist, perhaps even thrive, despite an oncoming wave of object-based information exchange. Above all, documents are simple to handle. Take email, for instance: small clients are easy to implement when the main tasks involve inspecting a data stream, parsing a few headers, and processing that stream accordingly. Sending is similarly straightforward (though implementation quirks exist in practice).

Another major reason, I believe, lies in the historical inertia of data systems. The Y2K problem is a stark reminder of how computing is entangled with its own legacy. Documents are likely to endure simply because they have endured. A parallel example can be found in operating systems: compare those that are file-oriented with those that are object-oriented. File-based systems are still overwhelmingly dominant today, despite technically promising alternatives like the Newton OS, which was deeply object-based.

This historical dependency and the sheer simplicity of documents mean that my imagined “revolution” may never occur. But there are also compelling arguments for why object-based models could form the foundation of a new kind of web--or even replace the existing one altogether. After all, there’s nothing requiring us to stick with the document paradigm forever.

One existing sign of this shift is that documents (e.g. HTML) are already being wrapped in object models like the DOM. As a result, the specific format or HTML version becomes less important than the structure of the object itself. Of course, we still need tools to interpret these objects, but we are increasingly less dependent on the raw HTML spec. We might not even need markup languages or documents as the foundation anymore. Instead, documents are encapsulated within more general-purpose objects. This coincides with the increasing dynamism being injected into document formats--via scripting languages, visual layout tools, and more. One might argue that starting from code and arriving at hypertext as one of many applications could be more coherent than the reverse.

A side note: many modern documents are already so laden with non-textual content that it might actually be simpler to transmit executable artifacts than to bog everything down with scripting layers. Hypertext, as originally conceived, was supposed to point outward, linking ideas and texts in a distributed way. But much of today’s usage is inward-facing--clicking around without much direction. One could imagine instead a kind of curated index, where every destination is listed and ranked, and navigation follows a more structured path. The egalitarian flatness of today’s hypertext might eventually give way to a new hierarchy. Object browsing would not necessarily prevent that--though it may not accelerate it either. Under the object-based model, hypertext becomes just one part of the web rather than its structural backbone. And since documents allow for both simplicity and complexity, they arguably represent a more “democratic” model than a fully object-oriented one--an important point not to overlook.

One argument, then, is that today’s web could be wrapped within an object-based web. A second is that executable content is becoming the dominant mode of information exchange, overtaking the earlier focus on static text and images. A third is that once even a small set of systems begins using objects--for instance, object-based mail clients and servers--it’s plausible that broader software support would follow. In contrast, the current trend, with HTML4 and Dynamic HTML creeping into email and bloating the format, feels like a worse path--one that sacrifices clarity and structure. The object approach could offer a cleaner and more intelligible alternative.
