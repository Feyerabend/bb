## Elemntary Server Tasks

To illustrate servers, such as web servers, can be difficult without actually going
through cloud services such as AWS or Azure, and even a small server can be complicated.
Thus, we will illustrate some common server tasks here using simple code examples to
demonstrate key concepts in a manageable way.

These tasks include: *load balancing*, where we distribute incoming requests across
multiple servers to avoid overloading any single one; *monitoring*, to track the health
and performance of servers and ensure they are running properly; *logging*, to record
task-related information for debugging and analysis; *fault tolerance*, where servers
can recover from failures or continue functioning despite errors; *memoization* (cache),
to improve performance by storing the results of expensive function calls for future
use; and *priority queues*, which allow tasks to be processed based on priority levels
rather than in a strict order. These examples will provide some insights into server
management concepts that are fundamental in both small-scale and cloud-based environments.
