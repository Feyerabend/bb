## Elementary Server Tasks

To illustrate servers, such as web servers, can be difficult without actually going
through cloud services such as AWS or Azure, and even a small server can be complicated.
Thus, we will illustrate some common server tasks here using simple code examples to
demonstrate key concepts in a manageable way.

These tasks include: *load balancing*, where we distribute incoming requests across
multiple servers to avoid overloading any single one; *monitoring*, to track the health
and performance of servers and ensure they are running properly; *logging*, to record
task-related information for debugging and analysis; *fault tolerance*, where servers
can recover from failures or continue functioning despite errors; *memoization* (cache),
to improve performance by storing the results of expensive function calls for future
use; and *priority queues*, which allow tasks to be processed based on priority levels
rather than in a strict order. These examples will provide some insights into server
management concepts that are fundamental in both small-scale and cloud-based environments.


### Load Balancing

Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic or computational
tasks across multiple servers or resources to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed.
This improves performance, reliability, and availability by ensuring that the workload
is evenly distributed among all available servers.

- Origins: The concept of load balancing emerged in the early days of distributed systems
  and server architecture as web servers started gaining popularity in the mid-1990s.
  Initially, it was done manually by administrators, but as internet traffic grew,
  automated methods were developed.

- Advancements: In the late 1990s and early 2000s, technologies like Round Robin DNS and
  Hardware Load Balancers became popular. Over time, software-based load balancers and
  cloud-based solutions (like AWS Elastic Load Balancing) evolved to handle highly dynamic
  and scalable web applications.

- Modern Usage: Today, load balancing is crucial in cloud environments, where it ensures
  scalability and high availability. Cloud services, like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud,
  offer load balancing services as part of their infrastructure.

Technical Details:
- Methods:
    - Round Robin: Distributes requests sequentially across all servers.
    - Least Connections: Directs traffic to the server with the least active connections.
    - IP Hash: Uses the client’s IP address to determine which server should handle
      the request.
    - Weighted Load Balancing: Assigns different weights to servers, sending more traffic
      to higher-capacity servers.
- Layer: Load balancing can be done at the application layer (HTTP/S), transport layer
  (TCP), or network layer (IP).


### Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system to continue operating properly in
the event of the failure of some of its components. It ensures that the system remains
functional even if certain parts of the infrastructure fail, either temporarily or
permanently.

- Origins: Fault tolerance concepts were first explored in mainframe and early distributed
  systems where high availability was crucial. In the 1980s and 1990s, fault-tolerant
  architectures, like RAID and clustering, were introduced.

- Advancements: In the 2000s, fault tolerance became a core aspect of cloud computing.
  Services like AWS EC2 and Google Cloud built fault tolerance into their infrastructure,
  using techniques like auto-scaling, replication, and failover.

- Modern Usage: In modern microservices architectures, fault tolerance is implemented
  through patterns like circuit breakers, retry logic, and graceful degradation.

Technical Details:
- Replication: Data is duplicated across multiple servers to ensure that one copy is
  available if another fails.
- Failover: In case of server failure, traffic is automatically redirected to a
  healthy server.
- Graceful Degradation: When part of the system fails, it continues operating in a
  reduced capacity instead of failing completely.


### Priority Queue

A priority queue is a data structure where each element is assigned a priority,
and elements are dequeued in order of their priority. Higher-priority elements
are processed before lower-priority ones. It’s useful for tasks like scheduling,
job management, and message handling.

- Origins: Priority queues are a variant of regular queues, first introduced in
  computer science literature in the 1960s. They were initially used in operating
  systems and scheduling algorithms.

- Advancements: Priority queues are now implemented in various programming languages
  using efficient data structures like heaps (binary heaps, Fibonacci heaps).

- Modern Usage: Priority queues are widely used in algorithms (like Dijkstra’s
  shortest path algorithm) and are also fundamental in message queue systems and
  task schedulers (such as Celery, RabbitMQ).

Technical Details:
- Data Structures:
    - Binary Heap: A tree-based structure where the parent node has higher
      (or lower) priority than its children.
    - Fibonacci Heap: A more advanced heap structure that provides better
      amortized time complexities for certain operations.
- Applications: Used in job scheduling, real-time systems, and systems that need
  to prioritize tasks, such as databases and networking protocols.


### Monitoring

Monitoring is the continuous tracking of server health, performance, and resource
usage. It involves collecting data about the server’s operation, such as CPU usage,
memory utilization, network traffic, and disk I/O, and using this data to ensure
the server is functioning as expected.

- Origins: Early monitoring tools were simple log-based systems that gave administrators
  visibility into the server’s operational state. Systems like Nagios (1999) became
  popular for basic monitoring.

- Advancements: As cloud computing emerged in the 2000s, monitoring became more complex,
  leading to the development of advanced monitoring solutions like Prometheus, Datadog,
  and New Relic.

- Modern Usage: Monitoring now includes sophisticated alerting mechanisms, anomaly
  detection, and predictive analytics to ensure uptime and performance in large-scale,
  dynamic environments.

Technical Details:
- Metrics:
    - System Metrics: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic.
    - Application Metrics: Response times, error rates, throughput.
    - Log Data: Application logs, system logs, event logs.
- Tools:
    - Nagios, Zabbix for traditional monitoring.
    - Prometheus and Grafana for time-series monitoring.
    - Datadog, New Relic for cloud and application monitoring.


### Logging

Logging is the process of recording events or messages during the operation of an application
or server. Logs are used to capture important information, including errors, warnings, and
operational data, to diagnose issues, monitor system health, and maintain audit trails.

- Origins: Early systems simply stored logs in plain text files. In the 1990s, tools like
  Syslog became common for managing and centralizing logs across systems.

- Advancements: With the rise of distributed systems and microservices, centralized logging
  systems like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Fluentd became crucial for
  aggregating logs across multiple servers.

- Modern Usage: Today, logging is deeply integrated into cloud and containerized environments.
  Tools like Loggly, Datadog, and Splunk provide real-time log aggregation and analysis.

Technical Details:
- Log Levels: Common log levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. Each
  level represents the severity or importance of the logged event.
- Centralised Logging: Logs are aggregated from different servers and services into a
  central location for easier management.
- Structured Logging: Logs are written in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to make it
  easier to analyze using automated tools.


### Memoization (Caching)

Memoization is a technique where the results of expensive or repetitive function calls
are cached, so that subsequent calls with the same inputs can return the cached result
instead of recomputing it. It helps improve performance and reduces latency in computationally
expensive operations.

- Origins: Memoization has been a technique in computer science for decades, first
  formalised in the 1960s for optimizing recursive functions.

- Advancements: In the 2000s, caching became a widespread technique in web development,
  with tools like Memcached and Redis becoming the go-to solutions for high-performance
  caching.

- Modern Usage: Today, caching is commonly used in web applications, database queries,
  and distributed systems. It’s implemented both at the application level (e.g.
  in-memory caches) and at the system level (e.g. CDNs for caching static content).

Technical Details:
- Types of Cache:
    - In-memory: Cached data is stored in RAM for fast retrieval.
    - Distributed: Cached data is stored across multiple nodes (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- Cache Invalidation: Determines when cached data should be refreshed or discarded.
  This can be time-based or event-driven.


### Conclusion

Each of these server tasks—load balancing, monitoring, logging, fault tolerance, memoization,
and priority queues—addresses a fundamental aspect of system design, from resource management
to fault recovery, and from performance optimization to task prioritization. Understanding
these tasks and their underlying principles is crucial for designing robust, scalable, and
efficient systems, whether in small-scale environments or large cloud infrastructures.
