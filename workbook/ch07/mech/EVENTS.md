### Event-Driven & Reactive

| Mechanism | Description | Use Cases | Related Pattern(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Callback](./callback/) | Function invoked at a later point, usually by a framework | Event handling, async operations, sorting hooks | Observer, Inversion of Control |
| [Signal Handler](./signal/) | Async routine called in response to OS or hardware signals | Interrupt handling, Unix signals, exceptions | Observer, Interrupt Vector Table |
| [Event Loop](./event/) | Central loop dispatching async events | GUIs, servers, JavaScript runtimes | Reactor, Proactor |

First, let’s consider the Callback mechanism. Imagine a bustling kitchen where a chef delegates tasks to
assistants, not expecting immediate results but instead providing instructions to be executed later when
the task is complete. This is the essence of a *callback*: a function passed as an argument to another function
or framework, lying in wait until the right moment arrives to spring into action. The framework, perhaps
a web server or a user interface library, decides when to invoke this function, often in response to an
event like a user clicking a button or a file finishing its download. Callbacks shine in scenarios requiring
asynchronous operations--think of a web application fetching data from a server, where the callback function
processes the response once it arrives, or in sorting algorithms where a custom comparison function dictates
the order. This mechanism ties closely to the Observer pattern, where components listen for events and react
accordingly, and to Inversion of Control, where the framework, not the developer’s code, dictates the flow
of execution.

*Signal handlers* are specialised routines designed to respond to specific signals, such as a user pressing
Ctrl+C to interrupt a program or a hardware interrupt signaling a device’s readiness. These signals are often
asynchronous, arriving unpredictably, and the handler must be swift and precise, handling the interruption
without derailing the program’s flow. In Unix systems, for instance, a signal handler might catch a SIGTERM
to gracefully shut down a process, saving state before exiting. In exception handling, a similar principle
applies, where the handler catches and resolves unexpected errors. This mechanism is deeply tied to the
Observer pattern, as it listens for specific triggers, and to the Interrupt Vector Table, a low-level
structure mapping interrupts to their handlers.

The *event loop* is a central mechanism that runs continuously, polling for events—user inputs in a GUI,
incoming network requests in a server, or tasks in a JavaScript runtime—and dispatching them to the
appropriate handlers. It’s the backbone of graphical user interfaces, where it processes mouse clicks or
keyboard presses, and of web servers, where it manages multiple client connections. In JavaScript runtimes
like Node.js, the event loop is the maestro orchestrating asynchronous tasks, ensuring non-blocking performance.
This mechanism aligns with the Reactor pattern, which handles multiple events in a single-threaded environment,
and the Proactor pattern, which extends this for asynchronous I/O operations.

Together, these mechanisms--Callback, Signal Handler, and Event Loop--form a trio of strategies for managing
the unpredictable nature of asynchronous events. Callbacks offer flexibility, letting developers inject
custom logic into frameworks. Signal Handlers provide resilience, catching and managing unexpected interruptions.
Event Loops bring order, orchestrating a continuous flow of events in dynamic systems.
