## Jump Tables

A *jump table* is a programming technique that uses an array of function pointers or
addresses to implement efficient multi-way branching. Instead of using a series of
if-else statements or switch cases, you use an index to directly look up and jump to
the appropriate code segment.

Jump tables are fundamental to many systems. In interpreters and virtual machines, they
handle bytecode dispatch in Python and Java JVM, as well as instruction decode in emulators.
Operating systems use them for system call dispatch tables and interrupt vector tables.
Embedded systems employ them for state machine implementations, protocol handlers, and
real-time event processing.


#### Why Use Jump Tables?

Jump tables offer several advantages over traditional conditional branching. They
provide direct lookup and jump performance, avoiding multiple conditional checks,
while maintaining predictable constant-time operation selection. This eliminates
long chains of conditional statements and makes adding new operations as simple as
extending the table.

They're particularly valuable in interpreters and virtual machines, state machines,
embedded systems where performance matters, and any scenario with multiple mutually
exclusive code paths.


#### How Jump Tables Work

The basic concept involves three steps: index calculation using an operation code or
selector as an array index, table lookup to retrieve the function pointer from the jump
table, and indirect jump to call or jump to the retrieved address.




### Implementation Analysis

The provided files demonstrate jump table implementation at both high-level (C) and
low-level (ARM assembly) perspectives, offering insight into how this concept translates
across abstraction layers.


#### C Implementation

The C implementation shows a clean, idiomatic approach to jump tables:

```c
typedef int (*operation_fn)(int, int);

operation_fn jump_table[] = {
    add, subtract, multiply, divide
};
```

The C implementation demonstrates several key features. It uses function pointer typedef
for clarity and type checking, validates operation codes before table lookup, properly
handles edge cases like division by zero, and allows the compiler to handle all low-level
details automatically.

The `perform_operation` function elegantly maps operation codes (0-3) to arithmetic functions:

```c
if (operation_code >= 0 && operation_code < sizeof(jump_table) / sizeof(jump_table[0])) {
    return jump_table[operation_code](a, b);
}
```

This demonstrates how modern languages provide safety and readability while maintaining
the performance benefits of jump tables.


#### ARM Assembly Implementation

The ARM Thumb-2 assembly version reveals the underlying mechanics that make jump tables efficient:

```asm
LDR     r3, =jump_table       // Load address of jump table
LDR     r3, [r3, r0, LSL #2]  // Load function pointer from table
BX      r3                    // Jump to selected function
```

The assembly implementation reveals several technical details. The `LSL #2` (logical shift left by 2)
multiplies the index by 4, since ARM addresses are 4 bytes wide. The `BX r3` instruction performs the
actual jump to the computed address. The `.word` directives create the actual jump table data structure
in memory, while the code follows ARM calling conventions with r0 for operation selector, r1/r2 for
operands, and r0 for return value.

The jump table itself is defined as:

```asm
.align 2
jump_table:
    .word add_func
    .word sub_func
    .word mul_func
    .word div_func
```

This creates an array of 32-bit addresses pointing to each function implementation.



### High-Level vs Low-Level Implementation

| Aspect | C Version | ARM Assembly |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| *Abstraction Level* | High-level, compiler handles details | Direct hardware control |
| *Safety Features* | Automatic bounds checking, type safety | Manual validation required |
| *Code Readability* | Very readable and maintainable | Requires assembly knowledge |
| *Performance Control* | Compiler-optimized | Hand-optimized, predictable timing |
| *Portability* | Cross-platform compatibility | Architecture-specific |
| *Development Speed* | Fast development and debugging | Slower, more error-prone |


Both implementations achieve the fundamental benefit of jump tables: constant-time operation 
selection. However, they differ in their optimization approaches. The C implementation relies
on compiler optimization, may include additional safety checks, and remains portable across
different architectures. The assembly implementation is hand-tuned for specific hardware,
uses minimal instruction count, and provides predictable execution timing.

These implementations demonstrate several important concepts. The progression from C to
assembly illustrates how high-level language constructs map to underlying hardware operations,
with the C compiler essentially generating code similar to the assembly version. The C version
prioritizes safety and maintainability, while the assembly version optimizes for raw performance
and deterministic behavior. The ARM implementation showcases Thumb-2's mixed 16-bit/32-bit
instruction encoding, efficient address calculation using barrel shifter (`LSL #2`), and
branch exchange instruction (`BX`) for mode switching. The assembly version also explicitly
shows data alignment requirements (`.align 2`), memory organization of the jump table, and
direct memory address manipulation.


### Conclusion

Jump tables represent an elegant solution to the multi-way branching problem, offering
both performance benefits and code organization advantages. The contrast between C and
ARM assembly implementations highlights the value of understanding both high-level
abstractions and underlying hardware mechanisms.

For systems programmers, embedded developers, and anyone working on performance-critical
applications, jump tables provide a powerful tool for efficient code organization and
execution. The technique demonstrates how careful data structure design can dramatically
improve both code clarity and runtime performance.
