## Core System Mechanisms

| Mechanism Class | Examples | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| *Execution Contexts* | Threads, Processes, Coroutines, Tasks, Interrupt Handlers     | Units of execution that run code concurrently or asynchronously |
| *Memory Management*  | Virtual Memory, Memory Protection, Allocation, Garbage Collection | Control access, isolation, and allocation of memory resources |
| *I/O Handling*       | Blocking I/O, Non-blocking I/O, DMA, Interrupt-driven I/O     | Manage communication and data transfer with external devices |
| *Synchronisation Primitives* | Locks, Semaphores, Condition Variables, Atomics       | Coordinate safe access to shared resources between contexts |
| *Scheduling*         | Preemptive Scheduling, Cooperative Scheduling, Real-time Scheduling | Decide when and which execution context is run |
| *Communication Mechanisms* | Signals, Message Queues, Pipes, Shared Memory          | Enable data exchange between execution contexts or devices |
| *Interrupt & Exception Handling* | Hardware Interrupts, Software Interrupts, Exceptions | Respond to asynchronous events, errors, and hardware signals |
| *Timing & Clocks*    | Timers, Time Slicing, High-resolution Clocks                  | Measure time, schedule delays, and coordinate timed events |
