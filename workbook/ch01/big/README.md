## Big Numbers

In the world of computing, "big numbers" refers to numbers that are too large (or require
too much precision) to be represented using standard data types like `int`, `long`, or `double`.
These arbitrary precision numbers can have hundreds, thousands, or even millions of digits.


### The Problem with Standard Number Types

Most programming languages provide built-in numeric types with fixed sizes:

- *32-bit integers*: Can represent numbers up to about 2.1 billion
- *64-bit integers*: Can represent numbers up to about 9.2 × 10¹⁸
- *Double precision floats*: Can represent very large numbers but lose precision

But what happens when you need to:
- Calculate 100! (factorial of 100)?
- Work with cryptographic keys that are 2048 bits long?
- Perform financial calculations requiring exact decimal precision?
- Solve mathematical problems involving astronomical numbers?


#### Real-World Applications

Big numbers are essential in:

*Cryptography*: RSA encryption relies on the difficulty of factoring extremely
large numbers (often 2048+ bits long).

*Financial Systems*: When dealing with currencies, even small rounding errors
can compound into significant losses. Big decimal numbers ensure exact calculations.

*Scientific Computing*: Calculating things like the number of atoms in the universe
(≈ 10⁸⁰) or precise astronomical distances.

*Mathematical Research*: Working with prime numbers, calculating π to millions of
digits, or exploring number theory.


### Types of Big Numbers

#### Big Integers
These handle whole numbers of arbitrary size. No matter how large the number gets,
a big integer can represent it exactly.

```
Example: 12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
```

#### Big Decimals
These handle decimal numbers with arbitrary precision, avoiding the rounding errors
common with floating-point arithmetic.

```
Example: 1.234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
```

### How Big Numbers Work

#### The Challenge
Standard numbers are stored in fixed-size memory locations. A 32-bit integer uses
exactly 32 bits of memory. But big numbers need to grow dynamically as the numbers get larger.

#### The Solution: Arrays of Digits
Big number libraries typically store numbers as arrays of digits (or chunks of digits).
Think of it like how you might write a very large number on paper--you use as many digits as you need.

```
Standard int: [01001010] (8 bits = 74 in decimal)
Big integer:  [7][4][0][2][1][8][9][3][6][5] (stores 7402189365)
```

### Base Systems
Most implementations don't store one decimal digit per array element. Instead, they use a
larger base (like base 10,000 or base 2³²) to make operations more efficient.


### Some Operations on Big Numbers

__Addition__

Just like adding numbers by hand: start from the rightmost digit, add column by column,
carry over when needed. You know this.

```
  12345
+  6789
-------
  19134
```

__Multiplication__

More complex than addition, often using algorithms like:
- Grade school multiplication (for smaller numbers)
- Karatsuba algorithm (for medium numbers)  
- Fast Fourier Transform multiplication (for very large numbers)

__Division__

The most complex operation, often implemented using long division algorithms or more sophisticated methods.


### Implementation Strategies

*String-Based Approach*:
Store numbers as strings of digits. Simple to understand but can be slow for arithmetic operations.

*Array-Based Approach*:
Store numbers as arrays of integers, where each element represents multiple digits. More efficient for calculations.

*Hybrid Approaches*:
Combine different strategies--perhaps using strings for I/O and arrays for computation.


### Popular Big Number Libraries

### Java
- `BigInteger` for arbitrary precision integers
- `BigDecimal` for arbitrary precision decimal numbers

### Python
- Built-in unlimited precision integers
- `Decimal` module for precise decimal arithmetic

### C/C++
- GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)
- Boost.Multiprecision

### JavaScript
- `BigInt` for large integers (built-in)
- Various libraries for decimal precision


### Performance Considerations

Big number operations are inherently slower than standard arithmetic because:

1. *Dynamic Memory*: Numbers can grow, requiring memory allocation
2. *Complex Algorithms*: Operations like multiplication use sophisticated algorithms
3. *No Hardware Support*: CPUs have built-in support for standard numbers but not arbitrary precision

However, modern implementations are highly optimised and can handle impressively large numbers
rather efficiently.


### Summary

Big numbers open up entire realms of mathematics and computing that would be impossible
with standard number types. They let us explore the truly infinite nature of mathematics
within the finite constraints of computer memory.

From the practical world of ensuring your financial calculations are exact, to the theoretical
realm of exploring mathematical constants to millions of digits, big numbers bridge the gap
between the mathematical ideal and computational reality.

Whether you're implementing cryptographic algorithms, building financial systems, or just
exploring the fascinating world of very large numbers, understanding big number arithmetic
is a valuable asset that opens up new computational possibilities.
