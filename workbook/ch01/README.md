# From Basics To Bytecode: A guide to computers and programming

## Foundations

We begin with an introduction to fundamental programming concepts,
including variables, control structures, and functions. Along the way,
we'll explore these topics in greater depth and cover related foundational
concepts. To enhance your understanding, you'll be encouraged to use
LLMs alongside your learning process. These tools will offer immediate
feedback, code suggestions, and explanations, helping you grasp the
material more effectively.
