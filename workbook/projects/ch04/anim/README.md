## Animation

The goal is to create a language that can handle basic animation, interaction, and rendering while being efficient enough to run on both high-level platforms (like JavaScript in browsers) and low-resource environments (like microcontrollers). Here’s a roadmap to get you started, focusing on core primitives, essential functions, and native operations.


### 1. Core Design Principles

Since you’re targeting both JavaScript and microcontrollers, simplicity and efficiency are key. The language should have:

- Lightweight syntax and minimal dependencies.
- Small but expressive set of core primitives for graphics and interaction.
- Ability to perform frame-based rendering for animation.
- Modularity so you can extend the language later with additional functions or features.

A stack-based VM (similar to Forth or a stripped-down version of the JavaScript VM) could work well, as it’s memory-efficient and relatively easy to implement in both high-level and low-level environments.


### 2. Core Primitives for Interactivity and Animation

To build the foundation for your language, start by defining a set of core primitives that would handle rendering, basic math, and interaction.

Rendering and Graphics Primitives

These primitives allow for basic shapes, transformations, and rendering, which form the core of any animation language:

- draw — Renders the current shape or object.
- clear — Clears the canvas or screen before redrawing, necessary for frame-based animations.
- rect, circle, line — Basic shape functions to draw rectangles, circles, and lines.
- color — Sets the color of subsequent drawing operations.
- translate, rotate, scale — Basic transformations, allowing animation via changing object positions, rotation, and scale over time.


#### Animation Primitives

Animation primitives are responsible for creating motion and transitions:

- frame — Starts a new frame in the animation loop.
- sleep or wait — Delays execution for a specific time (can be useful on JavaScript, while on a microcontroller, a timing system might differ).
- loop — Allows repeated execution of a block, helpful for creating animations and timed effects.
- ease — Provides easing functions, which would interpolate between values (such as positions or scales) to achieve smooth motion.


#### Interaction Primitives

Interactivity with the mouse, keyboard, or buttons will likely require asynchronous events:

- mouse_x, mouse_y — Stores the current mouse position.
- click or mousedown — Event handler for mouse clicks.
- keydown — Event handler for keyboard events.
- button — Reads button states (especially relevant on microcontrollers).


### 3. Essential Functions and Built-in Libraries

To add power to your language, implement a few essential mathematical and utility functions. These can either be built-in functions or implemented in the language itself (if it supports defining new functions).

#### Math Functions

Simple math functions are essential for positioning and transformations:

- sin, cos, atan2 — Useful for rotations and circular motions.
- lerp — Linear interpolation, for transitions between values (e.g., colors, positions).
- random — Generates random values, often used for procedural animations.


#### State Management Functions

State management helps in controlling graphics and interaction flows:

- push/pop — Stores and restores the transformation state, helpful for complex scenes with nested transformations.
- store and load — Store and retrieve variables or object states, useful for animation states or interactivity.

### 4. Defining a Basic Instruction Set

Your VM will need a small instruction set to process these primitives, so here’s a list of basic operations the VM should support:

- Stack Operations: push, pop, dup, swap for stack management.
- Arithmetic Operations: +, -, *, / for basic math.
- Comparison and Logic: <, >, ==, !=, and, or, not for decision-making.
- Control Flow: if, else, while, repeat for loops and branching.

### 5. Native Functions and VM Structure

Implement the following as native functions within the VM so they’re accessible as low-level operations. These could be JavaScript functions (for a browser-based VM) or implemented in C or assembly for microcontrollers:

- Graphics Commands: Render functions (e.g., rect, circle, color) should directly map to the VM’s graphics layer. On JavaScript, this might wrap HTML Canvas commands; on a microcontroller, it might work with a hardware graphics library.
- Event Handlers: For interactivity, you’ll need native functions to handle events like click, keydown, etc. In JavaScript, this could use event listeners; on microcontrollers, this could poll buttons or touch inputs.
- Timing: Implement a sleep function to control animation timing. In JavaScript, setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame can be used; on a microcontroller, you may need to rely on timer interrupts or delay functions.


### 6. Example Program Structure in Your Language

Here’s what a simple interactive animation might look like in your custom language:

```
frame {
    clear
    mouse_x mouse_y translate

    color 255 0 0
    50 50 rect draw

    mouse_x 200 > if {
        color 0 255 0
        30 30 circle draw
    }
    
    loop
}
```

In this example:

- frame initializes a new frame.
- clear clears the canvas for animation.
- translate moves the shape based on the mouse position.
- The if statement makes a decision based on the mouse’s x-coordinate.
- loop keeps the animation running indefinitely.


### 7. Testing and Expanding

Start by building your language with a minimal interpreter in JavaScript. You can use HTML Canvas for rendering and map mouse events directly. Once this is stable, you can port the core VM to a microcontroller, using compatible libraries for rendering and event handling.

With these primitives and a stack-based instruction set, you’ll have a foundational language capable of interactive graphics and simple animations, flexible enough to extend as your requirements grow.
