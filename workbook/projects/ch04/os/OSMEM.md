Adding a simple memory management module for your OS on the Raspberry Pi Pico will give you basic dynamic memory allocation. Since the RP2040 microcontroller doesn't have an MMU (Memory Management Unit), we'll implement a simple allocator, such as a *first-fit allocator*, which is common for embedded systems.

The following steps outline how to create a basic memory manager with malloc and free functions, working directly with a statically allocated memory pool.


1. Set Up a Memory Pool

First, define a block of memory that acts as the heap. This pool will be used for all allocations and deallocations.

Let's assume a simple memory pool of 4KB.

```c
#define HEAP_SIZE 4096
static uint8_t heap[HEAP_SIZE];
```

2. Define a Header for Each Memory Block

Each allocated block will have a header containing metadata:

- Size: The size of the block.
- In-use flag: Whether the block is currently allocated or free.

Define a structure for this header:

```c
typedef struct BlockHeader {
    uint32_t size;          // Size of the block (excluding header)
    uint8_t in_use;         // 1 if in use, 0 if free
    struct BlockHeader *next; // Pointer to the next block in the linked list
} BlockHeader;

#define HEADER_SIZE sizeof(BlockHeader)
```

3. Initialize the Memory Pool

We need to create a linked list of memory blocks, starting with a single free block covering the entire heap.

```c
BlockHeader *free_list = (BlockHeader *) heap;

void memory_init() {
    free_list->size = HEAP_SIZE - HEADER_SIZE;
    free_list->in_use = 0;
    free_list->next = NULL;
}
```

4. Implement malloc (First-Fit Allocation)

To allocate memory, traverse the free list and find the first free block with sufficient size. Split the block if itâ€™s larger than requested, creating a new free block after the allocated part.

```c
void *malloc(uint32_t size) {
    BlockHeader *current = free_list;

    while (current) {
        if (!current->in_use && current->size >= size) {
            // Found a suitable block, split if necessary
            if (current->size > size + HEADER_SIZE) {
                // Create a new block header for the remaining free space
                BlockHeader *new_block = (BlockHeader *)((uint8_t *)current + HEADER_SIZE + size);
                new_block->size = current->size - size - HEADER_SIZE;
                new_block->in_use = 0;
                new_block->next = current->next;

                // Update current block
                current->size = size;
                current->next = new_block;
            }
            current->in_use = 1;
            return (void *)((uint8_t *)current + HEADER_SIZE); // Return pointer after header
        }
        current = current->next;
    }
    return NULL; // No suitable block found
}
```

5. Implement free

The free function marks a block as free and tries to merge it with adjacent free blocks to avoid fragmentation.

```c
void free(void *ptr) {
    if (!ptr) return;

    BlockHeader *block = (BlockHeader *)((uint8_t *)ptr - HEADER_SIZE);
    block->in_use = 0;

    // Coalesce with next block if free
    if (block->next && !block->next->in_use) {
        block->size += HEADER_SIZE + block->next->size;
        block->next = block->next->next;
    }

    // Coalesce with previous block if free
    BlockHeader *prev = free_list;
    while (prev && prev->next != block) {
        prev = prev->next;
    }

    if (prev && !prev->in_use) {
        prev->size += HEADER_SIZE + block->size;
        prev->next = block->next;
    }
}
```

6. Testing the Allocator

Here is a simple test function to see the allocator in action:

```c
void test_memory_manager() {
    memory_init();
    
    void *ptr1 = malloc(100);
    uart_send_string("Allocated 100 bytes\n");

    void *ptr2 = malloc(200);
    uart_send_string("Allocated 200 bytes\n");

    free(ptr1);
    uart_send_string("Freed 100 bytes\n");

    void *ptr3 = malloc(50);
    uart_send_string("Allocated 50 bytes\n");

    free(ptr2);
    uart_send_string("Freed 200 bytes\n");

    free(ptr3);
    uart_send_string("Freed 50 bytes\n");
}
```

Explanation of Key Parts

1. Block Splitting in malloc:
    - If a free block is larger than needed, we split it, creating a new free block header at the end of the allocated part. This maximizes the use of available memory.
2. Coalescing in free:
	- When a block is freed, the allocator merges it with adjacent free blocks if possible, reducing fragmentation.
3. Memory Initialization:
	- We initialize the free list to a single large free block spanning the entire heap. This setup helps the allocator start with a clean slate.

Limitations and Extensions

This memory manager is basic and lacks several advanced features:

- No Boundary Tags: Boundary tags simplify coalescing but add overhead.
- No Block Splitting on Exact Fit: If a block fits exactly, there's no need to split.
- Best-Fit Strategy: The first-fit algorithm is simple, but a best-fit strategy can reduce fragmentation in some cases.

By adding this memory management module, you get a fully functioning dynamic memory allocator suited to small, embedded systems. This is ideal for educational purposes and understanding the fundamentals of embedded OS development on a simple microcontroller like the RP2040.
