The output “Predicted class: 1” indicates that the fully connected layer classified the pooled output of your CNN as belonging to class 1. Given the context of your convolutional neural network (CNN), let’s break down the computation to understand how this prediction was made.

Step-by-Step Breakdown of the CNN Process

	1.	Input Image:
Your input image is a 4x4 matrix:

input_image = [
    [1, 2, 0, 1],
    [3, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 2, 3, 1],
    [1, 0, 2, 3]
]


	2.	Convolution:
With a 2x2 filter:

filter = [
    [1, -1],
    [-1, 1]
]

The convolution operation generates a 3x3 output matrix (since the filter size is 2x2):

conv_output = convolution(input_image, filter)

Each element in this output is computed by applying the filter over the input image.

	3.	ReLU Activation:
The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function replaces all negative values in the output of the convolution with zero. After applying ReLU, the output will look like this:

relu_output = relu(conv_output)


	4.	Max Pooling:
The max pooling operation reduces the dimensions of the feature map by taking the maximum value in each 2x2 block. For your input, this results in a smaller matrix. Given your 3x3 ReLU output, the max pooling might produce a 1x1 output, depending on how the dimensions align.
	5.	Fully Connected Layer:
The fully connected layer then sums the values from the pooled output to produce a single score. In your implementation:

flattened = [item for sublist in input_matrix for item in sublist]
total = sum(flattened)
return 1 if total > 0 else 0  # Classify based on summed values

If the total is greater than zero, it classifies the input as class 1; otherwise, it classifies it as class 0.

Analyzing the Result

Given the nature of your inputs and the operations performed:

	•	If the total sum of the values in the final output (from the pooling layer) was greater than zero, it would result in class 1.
	•	This suggests that the feature extraction through convolution, followed by the activation and pooling processes, identified characteristics in the input image that aligned with class 1.

Example Calculation (Hypothetical Values)

Let’s illustrate with hypothetical values assuming the convolution and ReLU steps produced the following output:

	•	Convolution Output (3x3, hypothetical values):

[[0, 1, 0],
 [2, 0, 0],
 [1, 2, 1]]


	•	ReLU Output (after applying ReLU):

[[0, 1, 0],
 [2, 0, 0],
 [1, 2, 1]]


	•	Max Pooling Output (after applying 2x2 pooling):

[[2]]  # Taking max from 2x2 blocks


	•	Fully Connected Layer:
	•	Flattened output: [2]
	•	Total = 2 (which is > 0) leads to the prediction of class 1.

Adjusting the Model or Output

If you were expecting a different class, you may want to:

	•	Check your filter: Ensure it’s appropriately designed to capture the features you’re interested in.
	•	Expand training data: Train on a broader dataset if applicable, especially if you plan to classify more complex images.
	•	Modify the threshold: If necessary, adjust the threshold in the fully connected layer if you want different behavior (for example, using a softmax output for multi-class classification).

Summary

The prediction of class 1 signifies that the network found a strong feature response in the input image as per the trained filters and processes.
