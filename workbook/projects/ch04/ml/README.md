## ML

When focusing specifically on machine learning algorithms that are easy to implement and
suitable for the Raspberry Pi Pico, you'll want to consider algorithms that have low memory
and computational requirements. Here's a list of machine learning algorithms that fit this
criterion, along with brief descriptions and considerations for implementing them in
MicroPython or C:


1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Description: KNN is a non-parametric, simple algorithm used for classification and regression. It classifies new instances based on the majority class of their k nearest neighbors in the training dataset.
- Use Case: Suitable for real-time classification tasks, such as predicting the type of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) based on historical data.
- Implementation: As shown in previous examples, KNN can be easily implemented in MicroPython or C. It involves calculating distances between points, which is computationally manageable for small datasets.

2. Linear Regression
- Description: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.
- Use Case: Predicting a continuous value such as temperature, based on past readings.
- Implementation: Linear regression can be implemented using basic mathematical operations, and it doesn't require a large amount of data to work effectively.

3. Decision Trees
- Description: A tree-like model that makes decisions based on feature values. It is interpretable and easy to understand.
- Use Case: Classifying environmental data (e.g., classifying weather conditions) based on specific thresholds for features like temperature and humidity.
- Implementation: Decision trees can be implemented with simple conditions and branching logic in MicroPython or C.

4. Naive Bayes Classifier
- Description: A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem, assuming independence among features.
- Use Case: Classifying sensor data, such as distinguishing between different environmental states (e.g., sunny, rainy) based on temperature and humidity.
- Implementation: Naive Bayes can be implemented with straightforward arithmetic operations and is efficient for small datasets.

5. Simple Neural Networks
- Description: A very basic neural network (e.g., single-layer perceptron) that can learn to approximate functions and perform basic classification tasks.
- Use Case: Predicting outcomes based on sensor inputs or classifying input data.
- Implementation: Although neural networks can be more complex, a simple implementation with one or two neurons can fit within the constraints of the Pico. You can implement feedforward and basic backpropagation using basic array manipulations.

Example Implementations

Here's how you might implement a couple of these algorithms in MicroPython for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

K-Nearest Neighbors Example in MicroPython

```python
def knn_predict(data, new_point, k=3):
    distances = []
    
    # Calculate distances to each point in the dataset
    for point in data:
        distance = ((point[0] - new_point[0]) ** 2 + (point[1] - new_point[1]) ** 2) ** 0.5
        distances.append((distance, point[2]))  # point[2] is the label

    # Sort by distance
    distances.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    # Get the k nearest neighbors
    k_nearest = distances[:k]

    # Count labels of neighbors
    labels = {}
    for _, label in k_nearest:
        if label in labels:
            labels[label] += 1
        else:
            labels[label] = 1

    # Determine the most common label
    predicted_label = max(labels, key=labels.get)
    return predicted_label

# Example usage
dataset = [(1, 2, 0), (2, 3, 0), (3, 1, 0), (6, 5, 1), (7, 6, 1), (8, 7, 1)]
new_data_point = (4, 5)  # New point to classify
predicted = knn_predict(dataset, new_data_point)
print("Predicted label:", predicted)
```

Linear Regression Example in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define DATA_SIZE 5

// Simple linear regression: y = mx + b
typedef struct {
    float slope;
    float intercept;
} LinearModel;

void train_linear_regression(float x[], float y[], LinearModel *model) {
    float sum_x = 0, sum_y = 0, sum_xy = 0, sum_x_squared = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < DATA_SIZE; i++) {
        sum_x += x[i];
        sum_y += y[i];
        sum_xy += x[i] * y[i];
        sum_x_squared += x[i] * x[i];
    }

    model->slope = (DATA_SIZE * sum_xy - sum_x * sum_y) / (DATA_SIZE * sum_x_squared - sum_x * sum_x);
    model->intercept = (sum_y - model->slope * sum_x) / DATA_SIZE;
}

float predict(LinearModel model, float x) {
    return model.slope * x + model.intercept;
}

int main() {
    float x[DATA_SIZE] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Example input data
    float y[DATA_SIZE] = {2.1, 2.9, 3.8, 4.7, 5.5}; // Example output data
    LinearModel model;

    train_linear_regression(x, y, &model);

    float new_input = 6; // Example input for prediction
    float predicted_value = predict(model, new_input);
    printf("Predicted value for x = %.2f is: %.2f\n", new_input, predicted_value);

    return 0;
}
```

Considerations for Implementation

1. Data Storage: Given the limited memory of the Pico, keep your datasets small and manageable.
   You can store historical data in a simple list or array.
2. Performance: While KNN is easy to understand and implement, it can be slow for larger datasets,
   especially as the number of dimensions increases. For small datasets, it works well.
3. Real-Time Constraints: Make sure the execution time of your algorithm meets your application's
   timing requirements, especially if you are dealing with real-time sensor data.
4. Memory Management: Be careful with memory allocations in C to avoid memory leaks, especially
   when dealing with dynamic datasets.

Conclusion

For the Raspberry Pi Pico, algorithms like KNN, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees offer a good
balance of simplicity and functionality for various machine learning tasks. They can effectively
work with the constraints of the Pico when implemented in either MicroPython or C. If you have a
