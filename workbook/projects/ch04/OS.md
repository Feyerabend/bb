Creating a very simple operating system (OS) for the Raspberry Pi Pico is a fascinating project! The RP2040 microcontroller on the Pico is based on two ARM Cortex-M0+ cores, and the process of building an OS for it generally involves low-level programming in C or Assembly. Here’s a step-by-step overview of how to get started without external libraries, with a focus on keeping things minimal and educational.

1. Set Up the Development Environment

First, make sure you have the necessary tools to write, compile, and upload code to the Pico.

	•	Toolchain: Install the arm-none-eabi toolchain, which is used to cross-compile code for ARM Cortex-M processors.
	•	On Linux or macOS: sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
	•	On Windows: You can install it as part of an ARM toolchain package from Arm’s website or through other distributions like MSYS2.
	•	Upload Method: Flashing code to the Pico can be done over USB by copying a .uf2 file, which you can create with the elf2uf2 tool that converts compiled binaries.

2. Write a Simple Startup Code in Assembly

Since we’re building from scratch, you need to set up a basic assembly file to initialize the stack pointer and define an entry point.

Here’s a simple startup.s file:

```
.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    ldr sp, =_stack_top        // Initialize stack pointer
    bl main                    // Call the main function
    b .                         // Infinite loop if main returns
```

This startup.s file does the following:

	1.	Sets the stack pointer (sp) to the top of memory (assume _stack_top is defined elsewhere).
	2.	Calls a main function, which will be our entry point in main.c.
	3.	If main returns, it goes into an infinite loop to avoid undefined behavior.

3. Define a Linker Script

Create a basic linker script to define the memory layout for the program, specifically specifying where code and stack should go in the memory map. Here’s a simple pico.ld:

```
MEMORY
{
    FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x10000000, LENGTH = 2M
    RAM (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 256K
}

SECTIONS
{
    .text : {
        *(.text*)
        *(.rodata*)
    } > FLASH

    .data : {
        *(.data*)
    } > RAM AT > FLASH

    .bss : {
        *(.bss*)
    } > RAM

    _stack_top = ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM);
}
```

This layout tells the linker where to place .text, .data, and .bss sections and specifies the stack top as the end of RAM.

4. Write the Main C Program

The main C program will act as the core of your simple OS. It could initialize peripherals, set up memory, and implement a basic scheduler if you want multi-threading.

Here’s a simple example of main.c that just blinks an LED:

```c
#define SYST_CSR    (*(volatile unsigned int*)0xE000E010)
#define SYST_RVR    (*(volatile unsigned int*)0xE000E014)
#define SYST_CVR    (*(volatile unsigned int*)0xE000E018)
#define GPIO_OUT    (*(volatile unsigned int*)0xD0000010)
#define GPIO_DIR    (*(volatile unsigned int*)0xD0000020)
#define LED_PIN     25

void delay(unsigned int ticks) {
    SYST_CVR = 0;              // Reset the timer counter
    SYST_RVR = ticks;          // Set reload value
    SYST_CSR = 5;              // Enable counter with no interrupt
    while ((SYST_CSR & (1 << 16)) == 0);  // Wait for the count flag
}

void main() {
    // Set LED_PIN as output
    GPIO_DIR |= (1 << LED_PIN);

    while (1) {
        GPIO_OUT ^= (1 << LED_PIN);  // Toggle LED
        delay(3000000);              // Delay for a while
    }
}
```

In this program:

	1.	GPIO Setup: It sets the LED pin as an output by configuring the GPIO registers.
	2.	Delay Function: Uses the SysTick timer to create a simple delay. This delay is calibrated by setting the SysTick registers.
	3.	Loop: In the main loop, the code toggles the LED pin and delays.

5. Compile and Link the Code

Use the arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain to compile and link the program.

# Compile the startup and main files
arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m0 -mthumb -c startup.s -o startup.o
arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m0 -mthumb -c main.c -o main.o

# Link the object files
arm-none-eabi-ld -T pico.ld startup.o main.o -o os.elf

# Convert to UF2 format for Pico
elf2uf2 os.elf os.uf2

The resulting os.uf2 file can be uploaded to the Raspberry Pi Pico by holding down the BOOTSEL button, connecting the Pico, and copying the .uf2 file to the mounted USB storage.

6. Extending the OS

Once you’ve verified this basic example, you can extend the OS by:

	1.	Implementing I/O: Set up UART for serial output to interact with the Pico.
	2.	Basic Task Scheduler: Implement a simple round-robin scheduler for multitasking.
	3.	Memory Management: Implement a basic allocator for dynamic memory if you want to add more complex tasks or threading.

Additional Tips

	•	For debugging, consider setting up UART or using GPIO pins to output debugging information.
	•	Avoid using C standard libraries unless you implement them yourself, as they rely on OS system calls not available on bare-metal systems.

This setup will give you a foundation for exploring basic OS concepts on the Raspberry Pi Pico and the ARM Cortex-M0 architecture.
