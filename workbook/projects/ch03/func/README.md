The example above is indeed more aligned with unit testing since it verifies a single method (add) in isolation. Functional testing, however, is often broader and tests multiple components working together to fulfill a user requirement or scenario end-to-end.

Let’s elevate this to a true functional test by defining a broader scenario that simulates how a user might interact with the calculator application as a whole. This will test the full flow of operations, including addition, subtraction, and possibly other features.

Functional Testing Example: Calculator Application Workflow

Suppose our calculator now has multiple functions and can handle a sequence of operations. A functional test might look like this:

Scenario: Calculate the Result of a Series of Operations

1. Requirement: The calculator application should handle a series of operations and give a final result according to operator precedence and left-to-right evaluation.

2. Input: The user enters a sequence of operations: 3 + 5 * 2 - 4 / 2

3. Expected Output: The application should return the correct answer based on the order of operations, which is 3 + (5 * 2) - (4 / 2) = 10

Functional Test Implementation

Here’s how a functional test might be implemented to simulate this user interaction:

```python
import unittest

# Assume a more advanced Calculator that supports multiple operations and sequences
class Calculator:
    def evaluate(self, expression):
        # This is a placeholder; the actual method would interpret and compute
        return eval(expression)  # In production, we would parse this ourselves

class TestCalculatorFunctional(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_series_of_operations(self):
        # Given: a calculator instance
        calculator = Calculator()
        
        # When: evaluating a complex expression
        expression = "3 + 5 * 2 - 4 / 2"
        result = calculator.evaluate(expression)
        
        # Then: the result should match the expected output based on operator precedence
        expected_result = 10  # 3 + (5 * 2) - (4 / 2)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result, "Calculator should correctly evaluate '3 + 5 * 2 - 4 / 2' as 10.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

Key Differences from Unit Testing

In this functional test:

- Multiple operations are tested in a single end-to-end scenario, rather than individually.
- The test is validating the behavior of the calculator as a whole—it simulates a user inputting a complex calculation, rather than focusing on individual operations like add or subtract.
- The test checks integration between parsing, operator precedence, and evaluation to ensure they work correctly together, rather than each in isolation.

This functional test goes beyond the boundaries of unit testing by treating the calculator as a black box and checking whether the entire workflow produces the expected outcome. It’s not interested in the internal logic of each operation but in verifying that the user-facing functionality works as required.
