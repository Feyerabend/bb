# From Basics To Bytecode: A guide to computers and programming


### Potential misalignment in MEM

The mem_malloc function simply returns a pointer offset by the size of the BlockHeader struct without ensuring the returned address aligns with the size of the requested data type. If the start address of memory_pool plus the BlockHeader size is not a multiple of the alignment requirement of the data type, it will result in misaligned access.

Misaligned access is when a program attempts to read from or write to a memory address that isn’t aligned according to the requirements of the data type being accessed. This can lead to inefficiencies, as some CPUs require additional cycles to handle misaligned data, or even critical errors, as certain architectures, such as ARM and older versions of SPARC, can crash or throw exceptions on misaligned access.

Alignment requirements typically depend on the data type and the CPU architecture. For example, a 4-byte integer might need to be stored at a memory address that is a multiple of 4, and a double (8 bytes) at a multiple of 8. Misaligned access occurs if data is stored at a non-multiple address, leading the CPU to perform extra work or to generate errors, impacting both performance and stability.

Could you try to solve this prolem?


Project Title: Aligned Memory Allocator with Misalignment Detection

Objective

Create a custom memory allocator in C that aligns memory allocations for different data types and includes a mechanism to detect and report misaligned accesses. This project will help students understand data alignment, memory management, and the performance implications of misaligned access on different architectures.

Project Outline

1.	Part 1: Basic Aligned Memory Allocator
	•	Write a simple memory allocator that guarantees allocations are aligned to the nearest multiple of a specified alignment (e.g., 4, 8, or 16 bytes).
	•	Allow allocations of different sizes, and ensure that each allocation meets the alignment requirement.
	•	Calculate the necessary padding to achieve the required alignment.
	•	Provide examples of allocating various data types (int, float, double) and ensure they align correctly.

2.	Part 2: Misalignment Detection and Reporting
	•	Extend the allocator to track memory allocations and detect misaligned accesses.
	•	Implement a function that verifies whether a given pointer is aligned for a specific data type and alignment.
	•	Simulate misaligned access by intentionally misaligning some data and observing the results on different architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM, where ARM may throw alignment errors).
	•	Write a test suite that attempts to read/write misaligned data and catches and reports these errors.

3.	Part 3: Performance Testing and Analysis (Optional)
	•	Compare the performance of aligned vs. misaligned memory access by running benchmarks (e.g., accessing arrays of aligned vs. misaligned integers).
	•	Record the difference in CPU cycles or execution time and analyze the performance impact of misaligned memory access.
