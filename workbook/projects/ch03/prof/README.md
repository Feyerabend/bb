## Project

*Make your own profiler, and here is where to start. We use the previous VM2 as the starting point.*

### Overview

The profiler is designed to monitor and report various aspects of the VM's execution, including:

1. Execution Time Tracking: It measures the total time taken for the VM to execute its instructions, as well as the execution time for individual opcodes. This helps identify which operations consume the most time.
2. Memory Usage Monitoring:
	- Current Memory: It tracks the amount of memory currently allocated for the VM's stack and variable storage.
	- Peak Memory: It records the maximum memory usage during the execution, providing insights into how memory consumption varies with different workloads.
3. Opcode Execution Statistics:
	- Count: The number of times each opcode is executed.
	- Execution Time: The cumulative time spent on each opcode, allowing for performance optimization by identifying bottlenecks in specific operations.
4. Stack Depth Tracking:
	- Current Stack Depth: It measures the current depth of the stack, reflecting how many elements are present at any given time.
	- Peak Stack Depth: It records the maximum depth reached during execution, which can be useful for understanding memory usage patterns and optimizing stack operations.

### Details

1. Data Structure:
	- The profiler uses a Profiler struct that holds various fields to track execution time, memory usage, opcode statistics, and stack depth.
	- Fields include arrays for tracking the start time of opcode executions, cumulative execution times, and counts of how many times each opcode has been executed.
2. Functions:
	-	Start and Stop Functions: Functions to start and stop profiling, capturing the start and end times.
	-	Opcode Profiling Functions: Functions to mark the beginning and end of opcode executions, updating time and count metrics accordingly.
	-	Memory Tracking Functions: Functions to track memory allocations and deallocations, updating current and peak memory usage.
	-	Stack Depth Functions: A function to update the current and peak stack depth based on the stack pointer (sp).
3. Integration with VM Operations:
	-	The profiler is integrated with VM operations such as push and pop to update stack depth dynamically.
	-	Memory tracking is incorporated within the VM's memory allocation and deallocation functions, allowing for accurate tracking of memory usage related to the stack and variable storage.
4. Output Reporting:
	-	A print function that summarizes the profiling results, displaying total execution time, peak memory usage, peak stack depth, and a detailed breakdown of opcode performance.

### Benefits

- Performance Optimization: By identifying slow opcodes and memory-intensive operations, developers can focus on optimizing critical sections of the code.
- Memory Management Insights: Understanding memory usage patterns helps ensure that the VM operates efficiently and can handle larger workloads without running into memory issues.
- Debugging Support: The profiler provides valuable metrics that can assist in debugging performance-related issues, enabling developers to identify and rectify inefficiencies in the VM's operation.

Conclusion

This profiler enhances the VM's capabilities by providing detailed performance insights, making it easier to optimize both execution speed and memory usage. It serves as a powerful tool for developers looking to refine their virtual machine implementation and ensure it operates efficiently under various conditions.
