To design an interpreter for PostScript based on the principles from the Blue Book, Green Book, and Red Book, the structure should incorporate a few essential components that handle PostScript’s stack-based operations, scoped dictionaries, and graphics state management. Here’s a structured outline for implementing a PostScript interpreter, describing each major part, the dependencies, and an overview of how these pieces work together.

Outline of a PostScript Interpreter

1. Lexer and Parser

	•	Purpose: Tokenize and parse the raw input source code into interpretable structures, like literals, operators, and procedures.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Tokenize the input into discrete symbols (numbers, names, operators, comments, etc.).
	•	Recognize and convert { ... } blocks into array structures that represent procedures.
	•	Distinguish between literal names (e.g., /name) and values (name).
	•	Outputs: Provides an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or sequential list of tokens for the interpreter to execute.

2. Interpreter Core

	•	Purpose: The central component responsible for evaluating tokens from the parsed input, managing stacks, and executing operations.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Fetch tokens sequentially from the AST and interpret each based on its type (literal, name, or operator).
	•	Manage the operand stack for pushing/popping values, numbers, strings, and references.
	•	Dispatch operators and commands to the appropriate handler functions.
	•	Handle the execution flow, including control structures like conditionals and loops.
	•	Core Functions:
	•	Execute Token: Processes each token, determining if it’s a literal, procedure, or operator, and performing the appropriate action.
	•	Handle Procedures: Defines and executes PostScript procedures, recursively interpreting each command within a procedure block.

3. Operand Stack

	•	Purpose: Serve as the primary storage for operands and intermediate results during execution.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Provide push and pop operations to manage operands.
	•	Support stack-manipulation operators like dup, pop, and exch.
	•	Handle type-checking for stack operations (e.g., ensuring required types for operations).
	•	Structure: Typically a LIFO structure with optional type annotations to ensure type safety during execution.

4. Dictionary Stack (Environment)

	•	Purpose: Provide scoped storage for variable and procedure definitions.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Support lexical scoping, allowing nested definitions of variables and procedures.
	•	Manage dictionaries for each scope, pushing new dictionaries for new contexts (e.g., within procedures).
	•	Support def and load operations for defining and retrieving values.
	•	Ensure dictionary lookup follows PostScript’s “most-recent” scope, searching from the innermost scope outward.
	•	Structure: Stack of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains mappings of names to values or procedure definitions.

5. Graphics State and State Stack

	•	Purpose: Maintain properties that influence graphical output, such as the current transformation matrix (CTM), color, line width, and font.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Track transformations (translation, scaling, rotation) using the CTM.
	•	Store graphical settings like color, line style, and line width, affecting the appearance of shapes.
	•	Provide gsave and grestore to push/pop the graphics state stack for managing local modifications without affecting the global state.
	•	Render graphical objects using operators like moveto, lineto, stroke, and fill.
	•	Structure: Stack-based graphics state, where each state holds properties for transformations and graphical attributes.

6. Operators and Commands

	•	Purpose: Implement the functionality of each PostScript operator, including arithmetic, stack manipulation, and graphics commands.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Define a mapping of operator names (e.g., add, sub, mul, div, moveto, lineto, etc.) to corresponding functions within the interpreter.
	•	Implement arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators for manipulating operand values.
	•	Support control flow operations (if, for, repeat) by altering the token execution flow.
	•	Structure: Dictionary or mapping of operator names to handler functions within the interpreter.

7. Procedure Handling

	•	Purpose: Allow users to define and execute reusable sequences of commands as PostScript procedures.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Define procedures using def with a /name and an array representing the sequence of commands.
	•	Handle procedure execution by recursively processing tokens in the procedure’s body.
	•	Enable nested or recursive procedure calls, adhering to the scoping rules set by the dictionary stack.
	•	Structure: Procedures are defined as arrays in the dictionary stack, associated with names prefixed by /.

8. Error Handling and Debugging

	•	Purpose: Provide feedback for errors such as stack underflow, undefined variables, type mismatches, and unsupported commands.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Handle and report errors gracefully, including detailed information about the context.
	•	Support debugging by offering trace information for procedure calls and stack operations.
	•	Structure: Exceptions for handling runtime errors, with potential debugging flags to enable verbose output.

Dependencies and Interactions

Each component depends on and interacts with others in specific ways:
	•	Parser: Depends on input source code and produces tokens/AST, feeding into the interpreter core.
	•	Interpreter Core: Main controller that sequentially processes tokens. Relies on the operand stack for operand management, the dictionary stack for variable lookup, and operators for execution.
	•	Operand Stack: Interacts closely with the interpreter core, where it stores intermediate values for operations and results.
	•	Dictionary Stack (Environment): Serves as the storage for variable and procedure definitions. The interpreter accesses it to look up and define variables.
	•	Graphics State: Works closely with graphical operators to render shapes and adjust settings.
	•	Operators: Modular functions that the interpreter calls based on token type.
	•	Procedure Handling: Interprets arrays as sequences of commands, potentially calling back into the interpreter core for nested execution.

Example Workflow

	1.	Input Parsing: A PostScript program (e.g., 100 200 moveto 300 400 lineto stroke) is tokenized.
	2.	Interpreter Execution: Tokens are processed in sequence:
	•	100 and 200 are pushed onto the operand stack.
	•	moveto pops values from the operand stack and updates the graphics state with a new position.
	•	lineto pops values and adds a line segment to the path.
	•	stroke renders the path to output, using the current graphics state.
	3.	Procedures and Definitions: Procedures like /drawSquare { ... } def are stored in the dictionary stack.
	4.	Graphics State Management: Commands like gsave and grestore save and restore graphical settings.
	5.	Error Handling: If an undefined variable or type mismatch occurs, an error message provides feedback.

Implementation Summary

This PostScript interpreter can be implemented in stages:
	1.	Parser and AST/Tokenization
	2.	Stack Management: Operand stack and dictionary stack.
	3.	Core Operations: Arithmetic, logical, and stack-manipulation functions.
	4.	Graphics State and Operators: Implementing basic drawing and transformation.
	5.	Procedures and Control Flow: Defining and calling procedures.
	6.	Testing and Debugging: Ensuring error handling and procedural correctness.

This design aims to emulate the core structure and flow of a PostScript interpreter, respecting its stack-based nature, lexical scoping, and graphic state management, allowing it to run complex graphical and text-based programs.
