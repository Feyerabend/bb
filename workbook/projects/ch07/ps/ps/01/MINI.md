1. Arithmetic Operations

	•	Basic arithmetic: add, sub, mul, div, neg, eq, lt, gt (for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, negation, and comparison).
	•	Example: 3 4 add pushes 7 onto the stack.

2. Stack Manipulation

	•	Push and pop: dup (duplicate the top element), exch (swap the top two elements), pop (discard the top element).
	•	Example: 10 20 exch swaps the stack to [20, 10].

3. Control Flow

	•	Conditional execution: if, ifelse for basic conditional execution.
	•	Example:

10 5 lt { 10 20 add } { 5 10 mul } ifelse

This checks if 10 is less than 5; if true, it adds 10 and 20, otherwise, it multiplies 5 and 10.

4. Basic Drawing

	•	Graphics state setup: Setting the current position and path can be essential.
	•	moveto (set the current position),
	•	lineto (draw a line from the current position),
	•	stroke (render the path),
	•	closepath (close a path).
	•	Example:

newpath
100 100 moveto
200 200 lineto
300 100 lineto
closepath
stroke



This would draw a triangle on the page.

5. Basic Fonts and Text

	•	Text rendering: The interpreter would need to handle basic text commands, such as show for rendering strings.
	•	Example:

/Helvetica findfont
12 scalefont
setfont
100 100 moveto
(Hello, World!) show



This would render the text “Hello, World!” at the position (100, 100).

6. Graphics State Operations

	•	Set color: setgray or setrgbcolor for monochrome or color rendering.
	•	Example:

0.5 setgray  % set to a gray value of 50%


	•	Line width: setlinewidth to control the thickness of lines drawn.
	•	Example:

2 setlinewidth



7. Path Construction and Filling

	•	Basic path construction: newpath, moveto, lineto, closepath.
	•	Filling paths: fill for filling the current path with the current fill color.
	•	Example:

newpath
100 100 moveto
200 200 lineto
100 200 lineto
closepath
fill



This would draw and fill a triangle.

8. Simple Procedures (Defining Functions)

	•	You can define simple procedures with def to create reusable code blocks.
	•	Example:

/square { 
  newpath
  100 100 moveto
  200 100 lineto
  200 200 lineto
  100 200 lineto
  closepath
  fill
} def

square  % this will call the square procedure



9. Comments

	•	PostScript allows comments using %, which the interpreter ignores. This is useful for documentation and debugging.
	•	Example:

% This is a comment



Additional Features (Optional for a Minimal Interpreter)

	•	Loops: Implement for loops or repeat for more complex iterative operations.
	•	Graphics Transformation: Basic scaling, rotation, and translation could be done with scale, rotate, and translate, though these are often considered more advanced.
	•	Basic Image Handling: While complex, it’s possible to define a basic image drawing procedure using image or imagemask.

Summary

A minimal PostScript interpreter should support:
	•	Arithmetic operations for basic calculations.
	•	Stack operations for manipulating data on the stack.
	•	Basic control flow with if, ifelse, and loops.
	•	Drawing capabilities like line drawing, path creation, and simple fills.
	•	Basic text rendering and font management.
	•	A simple graphics state management (e.g., color and line width).

With these capabilities, you’d be able to perform basic drawing (lines, shapes, and text) as well as some computation. This would form a functional, minimal PostScript interpreter. More advanced features like image manipulation, pattern fills, and complex path constructions would expand this set of instructions.
