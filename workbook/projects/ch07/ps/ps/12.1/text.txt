1. Complex Procedures

Here we focus on enhancing the interpreter to support complex control flows and nested procedures.
- Conditional Logic Enhancements: Ensure that the if, ifelse, and other conditional statements can handle nested structures. This will be crucial for any complex procedure that has its own logic or calls additional sub-procedures.
- Loops: Implement the handling of looping constructs such as for, repeat, and while. These will need to interact smoothly with the stack, popping and pushing appropriately within each loop cycle.
- Procedure Calls within Procedures: Ensure that the interpreter can handle recursive or nested procedure calls. Each call should properly maintain its own environment or context if variables are defined locally within the procedure.
- Error Handling: Add exceptions or warnings for unsupported operations or potential infinite loops.


2. Graphics Commands

With complex procedures working, we can look into more graphical functionalities to emulate PostScript’s graphical capabilities.
- Enhanced Graphics State: Since you already have a GraphicsState class, expand it to handle transformations like scaling, rotation, and translations more deeply. You may also want to extend support for line width, color manipulation, and transformations.

Shape Rendering:
- Implement functions for rendering basic shapes (e.g., moveto, lineto, stroke, fill, arc).
- Support the concept of “paths” where commands can accumulate to build up complex shapes.
- Make sure the shapes respect the current transformation matrix (CTM) so they scale, rotate, and move as expected when transformations are applied.

Graphics Stack:
- Implement gsave and grestore for managing nested graphical states. These are essential for scenarios where nested transformations or temporary style changes need to be reverted.


3. Testing and Refinement

Add test cases to validate each of these new functionalities:
- Test cases for nested procedures, complex conditions, and loops.
- Graphics command tests that verify transformations and rendering accuracy. If you have a way to visualize output, test that shapes are rendered as expected.
