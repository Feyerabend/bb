Interval arithmetic is a way to handle uncertainties and errors in calculations by working with intervals rather than precise numbers. In essence, each number is represented as an interval, which accounts for possible variations or uncertainties in the value. This is particularly useful in scenarios where we need to track errors that accumulate over multiple calculations.

Basics of Interval Arithmetic in C

In interval arithmetic, an interval is typically defined by a lower bound ￼ and an upper bound ￼. For example, an interval ￼ with ￼ would represent all values ￼ between ￼ and ￼.

Basic Operations

The basic interval operations are as follows:

	1.	Addition: ￼
	2.	Subtraction: ￼
	3.	Multiplication: ￼
	4.	Division (if ￼): ￼

Let’s create a simple C program to define intervals and perform these operations.

Interval Arithmetic in C

Here is an example in C that defines an interval structure and implements basic operations on intervals.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <float.h>

// Define the interval structure
typedef struct {
    double lower;
    double upper;
} Interval;

// Function to create an interval
Interval create_interval(double lower, double upper) {
    Interval i = { lower, upper };
    return i;
}

// Addition of two intervals
Interval add_intervals(Interval a, Interval b) {
    return create_interval(a.lower + b.lower, a.upper + b.upper);
}

// Subtraction of two intervals
Interval subtract_intervals(Interval a, Interval b) {
    return create_interval(a.lower - b.upper, a.upper - b.lower);
}

// Multiplication of two intervals
Interval multiply_intervals(Interval a, Interval b) {
    double lower = fmin(fmin(a.lower * b.lower, a.lower * b.upper),
                        fmin(a.upper * b.lower, a.upper * b.upper));
    double upper = fmax(fmax(a.lower * b.lower, a.lower * b.upper),
                        fmax(a.upper * b.lower, a.upper * b.upper));
    return create_interval(lower, upper);
}

// Division of two intervals
Interval divide_intervals(Interval a, Interval b) {
    if (b.lower <= 0 && b.upper >= 0) {
        printf("Error: Division by interval containing zero.\n");
        return create_interval(-DBL_MAX, DBL_MAX); // Return an undefined interval
    }
    double lower = fmin(fmin(a.lower / b.lower, a.lower / b.upper),
                        fmin(a.upper / b.lower, a.upper / b.upper));
    double upper = fmax(fmax(a.lower / b.lower, a.lower / b.upper),
                        fmax(a.upper / b.lower, a.upper / b.upper));
    return create_interval(lower, upper);
}

// Function to display an interval
void print_interval(Interval i) {
    printf("[%.2f, %.2f]\n", i.lower, i.upper);
}

int main() {
    // Define two intervals
    Interval i1 = create_interval(1.0, 2.0);
    Interval i2 = create_interval(3.0, 4.0);

    // Perform interval operations
    printf("Interval 1: ");
    print_interval(i1);

    printf("Interval 2: ");
    print_interval(i2);

    Interval sum = add_intervals(i1, i2);
    printf("Sum: ");
    print_interval(sum);

    Interval diff = subtract_intervals(i1, i2);
    printf("Difference: ");
    print_interval(diff);

    Interval prod = multiply_intervals(i1, i2);
    printf("Product: ");
    print_interval(prod);

    Interval quotient = divide_intervals(i1, i2);
    printf("Quotient: ");
    print_interval(quotient);

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation

	1.	The Interval structure holds the lower and upper bounds of an interval.
	2.	Each arithmetic function (add_intervals, subtract_intervals, etc.) calculates the result according to interval arithmetic rules.
	3.	The print_interval function prints the interval in a readable format.
	4.	In main(), two intervals ([1.0, 2.0] and [3.0, 4.0]) are defined, and the operations are performed and displayed.

Real-World Example: Measuring Uncertainty

Suppose we have two measurements:

	•	Length: ￼ cm
	•	Width: ￼ cm

We can use interval arithmetic to calculate the area with the uncertainty included.

	1.	Define intervals for length and width.
	2.	Use the multiplication operation to calculate the area interval.

By changing the values in main() to:

Interval length = create_interval(5.0, 5.1);
Interval width = create_interval(2.0, 2.1);
Interval area = multiply_intervals(length, width);
print_interval(area);

The output for the area would approximate [10.0, 10.71] cm², which represents the possible range for the area based on the given uncertainties in length and width.

This method is often applied in scientific measurements where uncertainty must be managed throughout the calculations to ensure accurate and reliable results.

### Basics of Interval Arithmetic in C

In interval arithmetic, an interval is typically defined by a lower bound \(a\) and an upper bound \(b\). For example, an interval \(I\) with \(a \leq x \leq b\) would represent all values \(x\) between \(a\) and \(b\).

#### Basic Operations

Suppose you have two intervals:
- $\( I = [a, b] \)$
- $\( J = [c, d] \)$

The basic interval operations are as follows:

1. *Addition*: $\( I + J = [a + c, b + d] \)$
2. *Subtraction*: $\( I - J = [a - d, b - c] \)$
3. *Multiplication*: $\( I \times J = [\min(ac, ad, bc, bd), \max(ac, ad, bc, bd)] \)$
4. *Division* (if $\(0 \notin J\)$): $\( I / J = [\min(a/c, a/d, b/c, b/d), \max(a/c, a/d, b/c, b/d)] \)$

Let's create a simple C program to define intervals and perform these operations.

    return i;
}

// Addition of two intervals
Interval add_intervals(Interval a, Interval b) {
    return create_interval(a.lower + b.lower, a.upper + b.upper);
}

// Subtraction of two intervals
Interval subtract_intervals(Interval a, Interval b) {
    return create_interval(a.lower - b.upper, a.upper - b.lower);
}

// Multiplication of two intervals
Interval multiply_intervals(Interval a, Interval b) {
    double lower = fmin(fmin(a.lower * b.lower, a.lower * b.upper),
                        fmin(a.upper * b.lower, a.upper * b.upper));
    double upper = fmax(fmax(a.lower * b.lower, a.lower * b.upper),
                        fmax(a.upper * b.lower, a.upper * b.upper));
    return create_interval(lower, upper);
}

        return create_interval(-DBL_MAX, DBL_MAX); // Return an undefined interval
    }
    double lower = fmin(fmin(a.lower / b.lower, a.lower / b.upper),
                        fmin(a.upper / b.lower, a.upper / b.upper));

    return create_interval(lower, upper);

Imagine we have two time intervals:
1. *Interval A*: `[2, 3]` hours (representing an event that can last between 2 and 3 hours).
2. *Interval B*: `[1, 1.5]` hours (representing another event that lasts between 1 and 1.5 hours).

We can use interval arithmetic to determine the combined range of times if these events occur back-to-back or overlap. 

Here's how we can do it in C.

### Interval Arithmetic for Time Intervals in C

In this example, we’ll extend the previous code to work with intervals that represent hours. We'll perform:
1. *Addition* to represent the total time if two intervals happen consecutively.
2. *Subtraction* to find the possible time difference between two intervals.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <float.h>
#include <math.h>

// Define the interval structure
typedef struct {
    double lower;
    double upper;
} Interval;

// Function to create an interval
Interval create_interval(double lower, double upper) {
    Interval i = { lower, upper };
    return i;
}

// Addition of two intervals
Interval add_intervals(Interval a, Interval b) {
    return create_interval(a.lower + b.lower, a.upper + b.upper);
}

// Subtraction of two intervals
Interval subtract_intervals(Interval a, Interval b) {
    return create_interval(a.lower - b.upper, a.upper - b.lower);
}

// Function to display an interval
void print_interval(Interval i) {
    printf("[%.2f, %.2f] hours\n", i.lower, i.upper);
}

int main() {
    // Define two time intervals in hours
    Interval event1 = create_interval(2.0, 3.0);   // Event duration between 2 to 3 hours
    Interval event2 = create_interval(1.0, 1.5);   // Event duration between 1 to 1.5 hours

    // Perform interval addition to find total duration if events are consecutive
    Interval total_duration = add_intervals(event1, event2);
    printf("Total duration if events are consecutive: ");
    print_interval(total_duration);

    // Perform interval subtraction to find the possible difference in time between events
    Interval time_difference = subtract_intervals(event1, event2);
    printf("Time difference between events: ");
    print_interval(time_difference);

    return 0;
}

When applying interval arithmetic to calendars and scheduling, the goal is often to manage overlapping events, compute possible time slots, and handle uncertainties around event durations or start times. Here’s how interval arithmetic can be applied to make scheduling and calendar management more efficient.

1. Representing Time Intervals for Events

Each event on a calendar can be represented as an interval that covers its start and end times:

	•	Start time: the earliest time the event could begin.
	•	End time: the latest time the event could conclude.

For example, an event might be scheduled as:

	•	Event A: [10:00, 11:30] (from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM)
	•	Event B: [11:00, 12:00] (from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM)

These intervals show the possible duration and start/end times of each event, allowing for some flexibility in scheduling if needed.

2. Checking for Overlaps

Interval arithmetic can help detect whether two events overlap. Given intervals A = [a_start, a_end] and B = [b_start, b_end], we can check if the intervals overlap by confirming that:

	•	The start of B is before the end of A, and
	•	The start of A is before the end of B.

In C, this would look like:

int intervals_overlap(Interval a, Interval b) {
    return (a.lower < b.upper && b.lower < a.upper);
}

If this function returns 1 (true), the events overlap, meaning they either need to be rescheduled or handled as a conflict.

3. Merging Intervals for Free Time Calculations

To calculate available time slots between events, you could:

	1.	Sort all events by start time.
	2.	Traverse the events, merging overlapping intervals.
	3.	Identify gaps between the merged intervals as free time.

For example, if we have events:

	•	Event A: [9:00, 10:30]
	•	Event B: [11:00, 12:00]
	•	Event C: [13:00, 14:30]

We can find available slots between them as:

	•	[10:30, 11:00]
	•	[12:00, 13:00]

This approach helps generate a list of free time slots on the calendar.

4. Adjusting for Uncertain Durations

Sometimes, the exact duration of an event isn’t known and can vary. By representing event durations as intervals, we can calculate the possible range for start times of subsequent events.

Consider:

	•	Event A with an uncertain duration: [1.5, 2.0] hours
	•	Event B scheduled to start immediately after Event A

If Event A starts at 10:00 AM, Event B could start anytime between:

	•	Earliest Start of B: 10:00 AM + 1.5 hours = 11:30 AM
	•	Latest Start of B: 10:00 AM + 2.0 hours = 12:00 PM

Using interval arithmetic, the time range for Event B’s start would be [11:30, 12:00].

Example Code for Scheduling in C

Here’s a simple C example applying these principles to check for overlaps and calculate free time slots.

#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    double start;  // Event start time in hours (e.g., 9.0 for 9:00 AM)
    double end;    // Event end time in hours (e.g., 10.5 for 10:30 AM)
} Event;

int intervals_overlap(Event a, Event b) {
    return (a.start < b.end && b.start < a.end);
}

Event find_free_slot(Event a, Event b) {
    Event free_slot;
    free_slot.start = a.end;
    free_slot.end = b.start;
    return free_slot;
}

int main() {
    // Define two events
    Event event1 = {9.0, 10.5};  // 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM
    Event event2 = {11.0, 12.0}; // 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM

    // Check if events overlap
    if (intervals_overlap(event1, event2)) {
        printf("Events overlap.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Events do not overlap.\n");
        // Calculate and display free time slot between events
        Event free_slot = find_free_slot(event1, event2);
        printf("Free time slot: [%.2f, %.2f]\n", free_slot.start, free_slot.end);
    }

    return 0;
}

Explanation of the Code

	1.	Event Structure: Holds start and end times as double values (representing hours in 24-hour format).
	2.	Overlap Check: The intervals_overlap function checks if two events overlap by comparing their start and end times.
	3.	Free Slot Calculation: If events don’t overlap, find_free_slot computes the interval between the two events, representing available time for scheduling.

Example Output

For events defined as:

	•	Event 1: [9.0, 10.5] (9:00 AM to 10:30 AM)
	•	Event 2: [11.0, 12.0] (11:00 AM to 12:00 PM)

The output will be:

Events do not overlap.
Free time slot: [10.50, 11.00]

This indicates a free slot between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM, ideal for another meeting or a break.

Real-World Usage

This approach is commonly used in calendar applications, allowing users to:

	•	Identify overlapping meetings.
	•	Calculate available time slots.
	•	Adjust scheduling based on uncertain or flexible durations, making interval arithmetic essential for efficient time management in dynamic environments.
