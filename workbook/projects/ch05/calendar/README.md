## Calendar programming language (CPL)

Designing a domain-specific language (DSL) for handling calendar data is an interesting challenge. The language should enable users to easily manipulate, analyze, and visualize calendar events while providing functionality for common operations like calculations, filtering, and aggregating data based on specific criteria. Below is an outline of what such a language might look like, including syntax, functions, and features.

Key Features of the Language

1. Event Representation: The language should have a clear way to define events with attributes such as start time, end time, title, location, and tags.
2. Date and Time Manipulation: Functions to manipulate dates and times, including addition/subtraction of time intervals, formatting, and comparisons.
3. Filtering and Searching: Functions to filter events based on various criteria (e.g., date range, keywords, tags).
4. Aggregation and Calculation: Ability to perform calculations such as total duration of events, count events, and group events by specific criteria (e.g., by day, week, or month).
5. User-Defined Functions: The ability to define custom functions for reusable logic.
6. Integration: The language should be able to import/export data to/from common formats (e.g., iCalendar, CSV).


### Example Syntax

Hereâ€™s a conceptual overview of what the syntax might look like:


#### Defining Events

```python
event "Meeting" {
    start: "2024-10-29T10:00:00"
    end: "2024-10-29T11:00:00"
    location: "Conference Room A"
    tags: ["work", "project"]
}
```

#### Basic Queries

```python
# Find all events on a specific date
events_on("2024-10-29")

# Filter events by tag
events_with_tag("work")

# Get all events between two dates
events_between("2024-10-01", "2024-10-31")
```

#### Calculations

```python
# Calculate the total duration of all "work" events
total_duration("work")  # Outputs: 5 hours 30 minutes

# Count events by location
count_events_by_location("Conference Room A")

# Group events by day and sum durations
group_events_by_day()
```

#### Custom Functions

```python
function hours_for_tag(tag) {
    let total = 0
    for each event in events {
        if event.tags includes tag {
            total += event.duration()
        }
    }
    return total
}
```

#### Example Use Cases

1.	Summarizing Time Spent:
	- Users can quickly generate reports showing the time spent on various projects based on event tags.
2.	Finding Conflicts:
	- Check if a new event overlaps with existing ones and suggest alternatives.
3.	Integration with Other Tools:
	- Easily import and export events to and from popular calendar applications like Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook.
4.	Visualizations:
	- Generate graphical representations of events over time, helping users to see busy and free periods at a glance.


#### Potential Functions and Commands

	-	event(): Define a new event.
	-	events_on(date): Retrieve events for a specific date.
	-	events_between(start_date, end_date): Retrieve events in a given date range.
	-	total_duration(tag): Calculate total time spent on events with a specific tag.
	-	events_with_location(location): Filter events by location.
	-	count_events_by_tag(tag): Count how many events are tagged with a specific tag.
	-	group_events_by_day(): Aggregate events by day and provide total duration for each day.
	-	import_events(file): Import events from a specified file.
	-	export_events(format): Export events in a specified format (e.g., iCalendar, CSV).

### Conclusion

The proposed language is aimed at making calendar data manipulation intuitive and efficient, allowing users to focus on managing their time rather than getting bogged down in the complexities of data handling. Depending on the target audience, the language could have varying degrees of complexity, from a simple command-line interface for basic operations to a more advanced scripting language for power users.
