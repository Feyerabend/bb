## Reports

Designing a data reporting language that works in conjunction with the calendar management DSL can enhance the user experience by providing
powerful reporting capabilities. This reporting language could allow users to query calendar data, generate reports, and produce visual
representations in a straightforward and expressive manner. Below are some ideas for how such a reporting language could be structured,
its syntax, features, and functionalities.

1. Data Querying: Allow users to query calendar data using familiar syntax, similar to SQL but tailored to the event-driven nature of calendar data.
2. Aggregation and Summary: Provide built-in functions for aggregating data, such as counting events, summing durations, and calculating averages.
3. Conditional Reporting: Enable conditional logic to generate reports based on certain criteria (e.g., only report events that meet specific conditions).
4. Formatting and Output Options: Support various output formats, such as plain text, HTML, Markdown, or CSV, to cater to different reporting needs.
5. Visualization: Integrate with libraries for visualizing data, allowing users to create charts and graphs directly from queries.
6. Integration with the Calendar DSL: Seamless interaction with the calendar data defined by the previous DSL, allowing users to pull data directly from their events.


### Example Syntax

Here’s a conceptual overview of what the syntax might look like for the reporting language:

### Defining a Report

```
report "Monthly Summary" {
    filter: events_between("2024-10-01", "2024-10-31")
    aggregate: {
        count_events() as total_events
        sum_duration() as total_hours
    }
    output: {
        format: "Markdown"
        title: "October 2024 Events Summary"
    }
}
```

#### Basic Queries and Reporting

```
# Generate a report for all "work" events
report "Work Events Report" {
    filter: events_with_tag("work")
    output: {
        format: "CSV"
    }
}

# Calculate total hours spent in meetings for October
report "Meeting Duration" {
    filter: events_with_location("Conference Room A")
    aggregate: {
        sum_duration() as total_meeting_time
    }
    output: {
        format: "PlainText"
    }
}
```

#### Conditional Logic

```
report "Important Work Events" {
    filter: events_with_tag("work") and events_on("2024-10-29")
    if count_events() > 0 {
        output: {
            format: "HTML"
            title: "Important Work Events on 2024-10-29"
        }
    } else {
        output: {
            format: "PlainText"
            message: "No important work events found."
        }
    }
}
```

#### Visualization

```
report "Event Distribution by Tag" {
    filter: events_between("2024-10-01", "2024-10-31")
    aggregate: {
        count_events_by_tag() as tag_distribution
    }
    visualize: {
        type: "BarChart"
        title: "Event Distribution by Tag"
    }
}
```

#### Example Use Cases

1. Monthly Summary Reports: Users can generate summary reports for events over a month, including counts, durations, and tags.
2. Workload Analysis: Analyze the distribution of events over time to understand where time is being spent.
3. Visual Reports: Create graphical representations of event distributions, helping users to quickly grasp the data.
4. Conditional Alerts: Provide alerts or messages based on certain conditions, such as highlighting important meetings or upcoming deadlines.


#### Potential Functions and Commands

- report(name): Define a new report.
- filter(condition): Specify conditions to filter events.
- aggregate(): Define aggregation functions such as count_events(), sum_duration(), and average_duration().
- output(format): Specify output format options (e.g., “PlainText”, “Markdown”, “CSV”).
- visualize(type): Define the type of visualization to generate (e.g., “BarChart”, “PieChart”).
- if (condition) {}: Conditional logic for dynamic reporting.
- include(events): Include specific events or criteria in the report.

### Conclusion

This reporting language aims to provide users with a flexible, expressive, and intuitive way to generate meaningful reports from their calendar data.
By allowing for detailed filtering, aggregation, and visualization options, users can gain valuable insights into how they manage their time and events.
