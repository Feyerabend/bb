## von Neumann machine

The von Neumann machine is a foundational computer architecture conceptualized in the 1940s by mathematician John von Neumann. It introduced the revolutionary idea of a stored-program model, where instructions and data share the same memory space, allowing a computer to execute sequences of instructions loaded into its memory. This design contrasted with earlier machines that were hardwired for specific tasks, offering flexibility and programmability that paved the way for modern computing. The architecture laid out core components—an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit, memory, and input/output—forming the basis of most computers to this day. Its principles were outlined in the 1945 report First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, co-authored by von Neumann, which deeply influenced subsequent computer development.
