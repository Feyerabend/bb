## fm

The code of `fm` (functional machine) give some head start for exploring functional langauges and implementations. It is not a virtual machine (as in these cases they easily become overly complicated, and as such not suitable for easy learning). It instead incorporates an interpreter (which is also a basis for our examples of virtual machines). Concepts of functional lanuages differs from traditional imperative ones, so implemetation might also show a connection, as implementation strucures in a more common patterns in Python.

## mem

A program that gives some ideas on how memory can be handled in a virtual machine, or a program that have need for memory management in e.g. a microcontroller.

## vmo

The code in `vmo` illustrates some object-oriented programming concepts in C, including dynamic memory management, the use of unions for flexible data representation, and basic VM execution models. They provide a foundation that can be expanded to include more complex operations and features, such as method invocation and more advanced data types.
