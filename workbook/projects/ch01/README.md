## Projects

This chapter offers multiple avenues for exploration, each designed to deepen your understanding of fundamental concepts. Here, as an example for exploring, we focus on the representation of real numbers in computers, stemming from the mathematical constructs of `real numbers.' We explore floating-point and fixed-point representations, fractions, and symbolic calculations, as well as the strengths and limitations of each approach. Code examples are provided to help you get started with practical applications.

You can further delve into how numbers are represented in various formats, such as binary, octal, and hexadecimal, each of which plays a unique role in computing. Additionally, explore more such as performing calculations with imaginary numbers and understanding their applications. You can even examine unconventional representations—like calculating with Roman numerals—to illustrate the diversity of numerical systems and the implications for computation.
