## Projects

This chapter in the book offers multiple avenues for exploration, each designed to
deepen your understanding of fundamental concepts. Here, as an example for exploring,
we focus on the representation of real numbers in computers, stemming from the mathematical
constructs of `real numbers.' We explore in code floating-point and fixed-point
representations, fractions, and symbolic calculations, as well as the strengths
and limitations of each approach. Code examples are provided to help you get
started with practical applications.

You can further delve into how numbers are represented in various formats, such as
binary, octal, and hexadecimal, each of which plays a unique role in computing.
Additionally, explore more such as performing calculations with imaginary numbers
and understanding their applications. You can even examine unconventional
representations—like calculating with Roman numerals—to illustrate the diversity
of numerical systems and the implications for computation.

### Float

A Python program that simulates floating-point arithmetic by decomposing numbers into their sign, mantissa, and exponent components, in line with the IEEE 754 floating-point standard.
