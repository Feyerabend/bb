> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The examples in this folder requires several *Raspberry Pi Pico W* (or wireless expansion to RPI Pico). It also assumes connecting sensors to a network/Pico. The code has consistently been built with __MicroPython__ which have often good support for sensors, and networking. The examples might naturally also be built with C, but the resulting code will be lengthy, relatively complex and may require many third party libraries, or files for sensors.
