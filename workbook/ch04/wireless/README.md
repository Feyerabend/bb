> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The examples in this folder requires several *Raspberry Pi Pico W* (or wireless expansion to RPI Pico). It also assumes connecting sensors to a network/Pico. The code has consistently been built with __MicroPython only__, which have often good support for sensors, and networking in libraries. You might enjoy enhancing some projects, or e.g. nodes, with building them in C as they do not build on each other, but are separated in different Picos and communication is not programming language dependent.
