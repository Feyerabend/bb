## Building and Experimenting

> Code and samples refer to the original Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040, dual-core Cortex-M0+,
> 133 MHz, 264 KB SRAM, 2 MB flash), unless specified otherwise.
> This is the currently the most affordable and easily accessible among the variations.
> You might have to modify code in case other alternatives are used, e.g. RPI Pico 2, or
> other boards with the RP2040 mounted.
