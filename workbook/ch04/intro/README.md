## An Introduction to Embedded Systems and Microelectronics

Some historical trends that have shaped modern computing and so on .. more history ..


#### Moore's Law

First proposed by Gordon Moore in 1965, Moore's Law is the observation that the number of
transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years. This trend drove decades
of exponential growth in computing power and miniaturization. While the law has slowed in
recent years due to physical limitations, its principles continue to influence how we design
and build technology.


#### Dennard Scaling

A complementary concept, Dennard Scaling, observed that as transistors shrank, their power
consumption also decreased, allowing for more powerful chips without increasing total heat
or power usage. This trend broke down around 2005, leading to a shift in the industry toward
multicore processors and a focus on energy efficiency.



### Embedded Systems with the Raspberry Pi Pico

This part introduces the world of embedded systems through the lens of a popular microcontroller,
the Raspberry Pi Pico. The Pico is an affordable, versatile platform that can be used for a
wide variety of projects.


#### How Microcontrollers are Used

Microcontrollers like the Pico are used in a huge range of applications, including:

* Sensor Interfacing: Reading data from the environment.  
* Actuator Control: Controlling motors, lights, and other outputs.  
* Real-Time Control: Managing tasks that require precise timing.  
* Human Interfaces: Responding to user input from buttons or touch sensors.  
* IoT and Networking: Connecting devices to the internet.


#### Types of Sensors

To perform these tasks, microcontrollers rely on various sensors. The document classifies
common sensors by their function:

* Temperature & Humidity: For weather stations and smart home devices.  
* Light & Colour: For automatic brightness and color recognition.  
* Motion & Position: For robotics and navigation.  
* Proximity & Distance: For object detection and collision avoidance.  
* Pressure & Gas: For air quality and altitude measurement.


#### Project Examples

Finally, the document provides an extensive list of real-world projects that can be built
using the Raspberry Pi Pico, from simple projects for beginners to more advanced applications.
Examples include:

* Gaming and Emulation: Building a retro game console.  
* Robotics: Creating a self-balancing robot.  
* IoT: Building a smart thermostat or an air quality monitor.  
* Audio and Music: Creating a simple synthesizer or a MIDI controller.  
* Wearables: Designing a fitness tracker.
