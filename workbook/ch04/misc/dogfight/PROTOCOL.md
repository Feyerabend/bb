## Dogfight Multiplayer Game Protocol

The `protocol.py` file defines a shared network protocol for a simple multiplayer
"Dogfight" game, used by both the server and clients. This protocol facilitates
communication in a turn-based or real-time multiplayer environment where two players
control characters (likely aircraft or similar) on a 100x80 grid. Players can move
in 8 directions, shoot projectiles, and the game tracks states like positions,
shots, and game-over conditions.


Features:
- *Packet-based communication*: Uses binary packets for efficiency, packed/unpacked
  with Python's `struct` module.
- *Packet types*: Include client inputs (button presses), full game state syncs,
  delta (incremental) updates, connection requests/acks, and ping/pong for latency monitoring.
- *Game mechanics implied*: Players have positions (x, y), directions (0-7 for N, NE, E, etc.),
  and can fire shots with range. The game detects hits, removals, and winners.
- *Efficiency focus*: Full states for initial sync or resync, deltas for ongoing updates
  to minimise bandwidth.
- *Assumptions*: UDP or similar unreliable transport (due to seq numbers for ordering),
  2-player only, no authentication.

This protocol is lightweight, suitable for low-latency games, but lacks error correction or security features.


## How the Protocol Works

### Connection Flow
1. *Client Connects*: The client sends a `PKT_CLIENT_CONNECT` packet (type 0x06) with player_id=0 to request joining.
2. *Server Acknowledges*: The server responds with a `PKT_CLIENT_ACK` packet (type 0x07) assigning a player_id (1 or 2).
3. *Game Starts*: Once connected, the server sends a `PKT_FULL_STATE` to sync the initial game world.

### Game Loop
- *Client Inputs*: Clients send `PKT_CLIENT_INPUT` packets (type 0x01) each frame, containing button states
  (A, B, X, Y â€“ likely for movement/shooting).
- *Server Updates*:
  - Processes inputs, updates game state (positions, shots, collisions).
  - Broadcasts `PKT_FULL_STATE` (type 0x02) for complete sync (e.g., at start or on desync).
  - Broadcasts `PKT_DELTA_STATE` (type 0x03) for incremental changes (position/dir updates, shots added/removed).
- *Shots and Collisions*: Shots move in directions with limited range; removed on hit or expiry.
  The server handles logic, clients render based on states.
- *Game Over*: Flagged in states with a winner (1 or 2).
- *Connection Monitoring*: Periodic `PKT_PING` (0x04) from server, `PKT_PONG` (0x05) responses from
  clients with timestamps for latency.


### Packet Structure Overview
- All packets start with a type byte (1 byte).
- Use fixed formats for packing/unpacking (e.g., "!BBBBBBxx" for inputs, with padding for alignment).
- Positions/shots use 1-byte unsigned ints (0-255), fitting the 100x80 grid.
- Sequence numbers (seq) in states help detect drops/reorders.

The protocol assumes a reliable underlying transport or handles retransmits externally.


## Illustrations

### Client-Server Connection and Game Start

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    
    Client->>Server: PKT_CLIENT_CONNECT (type=0x06, player_id=0)
    Server->>Client: PKT_CLIENT_ACK (type=0x07, player_id=1 or 2)
    Note over Server: Assign player ID and add to game
    Server->>Client: PKT_FULL_STATE (type=0x02, full game sync: players, shots)
    Note over Client: Render initial state
```

This shows the initial handshake. Once connected, the client begins sending inputs.


### Ongoing Game Loop

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client1
    participant Server
    participant Client2
    
    loop Every Frame
        Client1->>Server: PKT_CLIENT_INPUT (type=0x01, buttons: A/B/X/Y)
        Client2->>Server: PKT_CLIENT_INPUT (type=0x01, buttons: A/B/X/Y)
        Note over Server: Process inputs, update positions/shots, check collisions/game over
        alt Minor Changes
            Server->>Client1: PKT_DELTA_STATE (type=0x03, deltas: pos changes, shots add/remove)
            Server->>Client2: PKT_DELTA_STATE (type=0x03, same deltas)
        else Full Sync Needed
            Server->>Client1: PKT_FULL_STATE (type=0x02, complete state)
            Server->>Client2: PKT_FULL_STATE (type=0x02, complete state)
        end
    end
    
    Note over Server: If game over, set flag in state packet
    Server->>Client1: PKT_DELTA_STATE (with game_over=True, winner=2)
    Server->>Client2: PKT_DELTA_STATE (with game_over=True, winner=2)
```

This illustrates the input-update-broadcast cycle. Deltas are used for efficiency during normal play.

### Key Data Structures

    class ClientInputPacket {
        +pack(player_id, btn_a, btn_b, btn_x, btn_y)
        +unpack(data)
    }
    
    class ConnectPacket {
        +pack_request()
        +pack_ack(player_id)
        +unpack(data)
    }
    
    class FullStatePacket {
        +pack(seq, p1_state, p2_state, p1_shots, p2_shots, game_over, winner)
        +unpack(data)
    }
    
    class DeltaStatePacket {
        +pack(seq, p1_pos, p2_pos, shots_added, shots_removed, game_over, winner)
        +unpack(data)
    }
    
    class PingPacket {
        +pack(seq, timestamp)
        +pack_pong(seq, timestamp)
        +unpack(data)
    }
    
    note for ClientInputPacket "Packets use struct for binary encoding/decoding"
```

This represents the main classes in `protocol.py`, showing methods for packing/unpacking.
