## Games

Not every, but many digital games take their departure from the visual. In the early history of arcade and video games,
the attraction often lay first in what players could see--the colours, shapes, and movement on the screen--even before
the depth of interaction was considered. Games like *Pong* (1972) demonstrated how a simple visual metaphor, two paddles
and a bouncing ball, could be enough to sustain competitive play. Similarly, *Space Invaders* (1978) and *Pac-Man* (1980)
relied heavily on striking visual identities: rows of alien sprites marching downward, or a yellow character pursued
through a neon maze. These designs were simple due to technical constraints, but their visual impact made them immediately
recognisable and compelling in a crowded arcade hall.


### Tetris

Tetris, however, represents a different strand of development. Its appeal is not based on character animation, narrative
images, or graphic spectacle. Instead, it reduces the visual field to the barest of forms: blocks made of four squares,
falling at a constant pace. Here, the focus shifts from visual recognition to cognitive challenge--from how the game looks
to how the player organises and anticipates patterns. This marks a significant divergence in digital game history. While
many arcade titles enticed players with characters and environments that could be "seen" as a form of story or identity,
Tetris drew players into a purely abstract, logical puzzle, visual only in the sense of geometry and spatial fit.

Thus, Tetris illustrates that not all digital games are visually driven in the same sense. Some games use imagery to
construct a world or characters with which the player engages, while others, like Tetris, use minimal visuals as a
vehicle for mechanics that are almost entirely cognitive. The history of video games therefore contains both traditions:
one built on spectacle and representation, the other on abstraction and mental engagement, both using the screen but
for very different ends.


### Racer

One of my earliest memories of arcade games goes back to *Night Driver* (1976) and *Gun Fight*--also known in Japan as
*Western Gun* (1975). Which company actually brought those cabinets to Sweden I could never say; at the time, they simply
appeared in restaurants and cafés as if by magic, their origins unknown and unimportant to us as young players.

Night Driver was always a precarious experience, since the steering wheels on the cabinets were often broken or loose,
making what was already a crude simulation of driving into something almost tragic to play. Gun Fight was different:
two cowboys duelling across a screen, firing through cacti and wooden obstacles. But the game depended on having an
opponent, and in my case that usually meant my sister, who had little interest in the gameplay--or at least that
was how I perceived it.

Racing games provide a useful counterpoint to the minimalism of Tetris. From the earliest examples such as *Night Driver*
but also later *Pole Position* (1982), the focus was overwhelmingly visual: the illusion of speed, the winding of the road,
and the shifting perspective of the horizon line. The player’s engagement depended as much on the sensation of movement
across a landscape as on the underlying mechanics of steering and avoiding obstacles. In the arcade, the physical cabinet
often reinforced this visual immersion, surrounding the player with a wheel, pedals, and sometimes even a moving seat.
Here, the visual design aimed to replicate an external world--the road, the track, the rival cars--and the appeal
lay in inhabiting that simulated environment.

Placed alongside a game like Tetris, racing games highlight two very different traditions in digital play. Racing relies
on spectacle, the recreation of a recognisable activity through dynamic graphics and motion cues. Tetris, by contrast,
strips away any reference to a real-world activity and situates its challenge purely within the manipulation of abstract
forms. Both genres depend on the screen, but one does so to create an illusion of realism, the other to pose an intellectual
problem. This divergence shows how video games can evolve from the same technological basis--the pixel and the display--yet
move in profoundly different aesthetic and experiential directions.
