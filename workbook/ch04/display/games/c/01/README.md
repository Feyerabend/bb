Mitxela creates very interesting projects.
This code began as a direct translation of his racer game
(https://mitxela.com/projects/console/retroracer)
to the Pico 2 with the Pimoroni Display Pack 2 in C.
However, I have changed many parts, though I remain indebted to his original design.

There are some additions:
- Only dirty regions are redrawn, rather than the entire screen.
- DMA support.
- And so on ..

Next, some images might be interesting to includeâ€¦ for example, filling in the noisy areas.
