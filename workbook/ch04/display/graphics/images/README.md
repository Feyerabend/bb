## Pixel Graphics and Images

1. Pixels
- Smallest unit of an image
- Grid structure (width × height)
- Value(s) per pixel (intensity or colour channels)

2. Image Representation
- Width, height
- Channels (grayscale, RGB, RGBA)
- Bit depth (8, 16, 32 bit)
- Indexed colour (palette)

3. Colour Models and Spaces
- RGB (additive, displays)
- CMYK (subtractive, printing)
- HSV/HSL (human-oriented)
- Grayscale
- YUV/Y'CbCr (video, compression)
- CIELAB (perceptual uniformity)

4. Image File Formats
- BMP (simple, uncompressed)
- PNG (lossless, transparency)
- JPEG (lossy, photos)
- GIF (indexed, animation)
- TIFF (flexible, professional)
- RAW (sensor data)
- PAM/PNM (plain, experimental)

5. Image Manipulations
- Geometric: scaling, rotation, cropping, mirroring
- Point ops: brightness, contrast, gamma, threshold
- Colour ops: RGB↔Grayscale, palette, colour space conversion

6. Filters and Convolution
- Convolution with kernel
- Blur (average, Gaussian)
- Sharpen
- Edge detection (Sobel, Laplacian)
- Embossing
- Noise reduction (median)

7. Higher-Level Techniques
- Morphological ops (erosion, dilation)
- Fourier transforms (frequency domain)
- Downsampling, mipmaps
- Compression (lossless/lossy)

8. Raster vs Vector
- Raster: pixel grid, resolution dependent
- Vector: scalable shapes, paths

9. Code Snippets (conceptual)
- Brightness adjust: add constant to channels
- Convolution: sliding window * kernel

10. Applications
- Photography & enhancement
- Computer vision
- Graphics/shaders
- Medical & satellite imaging
- Machine learning preprocessing
