## Vector Graphics

Looking back, it is interesting how my own fascination was tied to the aesthetics of vector graphics, while the
designers of the time were often motivated by very different concerns. Raster displays were expensive, memory was
limited, and processors could not always handle the overhead of moving and refreshing a full bitmap. Vector displays,
by contrast, required much less memory: the system only needed to store coordinates and instructions for drawing
lines or shapes. The screen then traced those vectors directly with the electron beam. What I admired as elegant
precision was, in fact, a clever optimisation born of necessity.

Of course, those same limitations shaped the unique look and feel of the technology. The crisp, glowing lines,
the smooth scaling, and the sense of immediacy in how objects appeared on screen were not simply engineering
compromises--they became an artistic medium in their own right. Games like *Asteroids* and *Battlezone* created
experiences that would have been impossible, or at least very different, on contemporary raster hardware.

Today, with nearly unlimited pixel resolution and powerful GPUs, it is easy to forget how distinctive those earlier
approaches were. But I think there is still something deeply appealing about vector displays: the way geometry is
represented directly, the simplicity of line art, and the connection between mathematics and imagery. In a sense,
they embody a kind of "purity" of graphics--one that still inspires me, even if the original motivation was
*cost efficiency* rather than visual clarity.

In fact, what fascinates me is how these ideas have never really gone away, even though raster graphics eventually
won out in mainstream displays. The concept of representing images as lines, curves, and shapes rather than as
fixed grids of pixels still thrives in many areas.

Think of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) on the web: a modern descendant of those same principles, where graphics
are described mathematically and can be scaled to any resolution without losing clarity. Or consider CAD systems,
which rely heavily on vector representations to describe technical drawings and 3D models with exact precision.
Even in hardware, oscilloscopes and laser projectors still use vector-style drawing, steering beams directly
to positions rather than painting an entire raster image.

There is also a kind of "maker culture" revival around these ideas. Plotters, CNC machines, and laser cutters
all work fundamentally with vector instructions, moving along paths instead of filling in pixels. What I once
admired in a cinema lobby arcade machine now reappears in tools for design, fabrication, and creative coding.

So although vector displays may have started as a cost-saving compromise, their legacy is richer than that.
They remind us that technical constraints can lead not only to clever solutions but also to new aesthetics and
new ways of thinking about imagery--lessons that still echo in todayâ€™s graphics, design, and digital fabrication.
