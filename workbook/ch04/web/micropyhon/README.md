> This example requires a small LCD display, specifically the Pimoroni Pico Display Pack 2.0 (though it can also be configured for the original Pimoroni Pico Display Pack). It also requires a Raspberry Pi Pico W (the wireless version of the Pico). The display needs a custom build of MicroPython, available either on GitHub from Pimoroniâ€™s accessory repositories or directly as an installation option within Thonny.
