> The examples [01](./01/) and [02](./02/) requires a small LCD display, specifically the Pimoroni Pico Display Pack 2.0 (though it can also be configured for the original Pimoroni Pico Display Pack). It also requires a Raspberry Pi Pico W (the wireless version of the Pico). The display needs a custom build of MicroPython, available either on GitHub from Pimoroniâ€™s accessory repositories or directly as an installation option within Thonny.

> The examples [03](./03/) and [04](./04/) requires the SD card setup which is in [db](./../../storage/db/).  It also requires a Raspberry Pi Pico W (the wireless version of the Pico).
