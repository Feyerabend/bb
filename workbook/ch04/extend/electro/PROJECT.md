### Part 2: Project Logbook (Build Milestones)

Milestone 1: Pico LED Trainer
- Breadboard a Pico with 4 LEDs and 4 resistors.
- Program binary counter output (0–15).

Milestone 2: Add Switches
- Breadboard 4 pushbuttons with pull-down resistors.
- Program Pico to echo button states on LEDs.

Milestone 3: First Logic Gate (NAND)
- Use 74HC00. Connect inputs to switches, outputs to LEDs.
- Verify truth table manually.

Milestone 4: Half & Full Adder
- Wire XOR + AND gates for half adder, then expand to full adder.
- Feed inputs via switches, outputs on LEDs.

Milestone 5: Flip-Flops
- Build SR latch from NAND gates.
- Upgrade to D flip-flop using 74HC74.
- Toggle LED storage bit on clock edge.

Milestone 6: 4-bit Register
- Chain 4 flip-flops.
- Load 4-bit number from switches.
- Display stored value on LEDs.

Milestone 7: ALU Prototype
- Wire 4-bit ripple adder with 74HC283.
- Add function select with mux.
- LEDs show results.

Milestone 8: Control via Pico
- Use Pico GPIOs to drive control signals (load register, select ALU op).
- Write small “microcode” program in Pico C/Python to automate.

Milestone 9: Replace Pico Control
- Breadboard binary counter + EEPROM with microcode.
- Program microinstructions into EEPROM.

Milestone 10: Memory + Program Counter
- Add RAM chip + simple addressing logic.
- Build program counter from counters.

Milestone 11: Front Panel Blinkenlights
- Wire switches for input, LEDs for registers + ALU + PC.
- Manually enter programs, run them, watch execution.

Milestone 12: Self-Contained Computer
- Run first “program” (e.g., load constant → add → output).
- Debug with single-step clock.
- Celebrate — you’ve built a working blinkenlights computer!
