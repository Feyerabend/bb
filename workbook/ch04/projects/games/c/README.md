## ECS Platform Game for Raspberry Pi Pico with Display Pack 2.0

A complete Mario-style platformer game built using Entity-Component-System
(ECS) architecture in C for the Raspberry Pi Pico/Pico 2/Pico 2W with
Pimoroni Display Pack 2.0.

- *Pure ECS Architecture*: Follows the design principles from ECSC.md
- *Smooth 30 FPS gameplay* with DMA-accelerated rendering
- *Mario-style mechanics*:
  - Double jump
  - Enemy stomping
  - Coin collection
  - Platform collision detection
  - Camera following
  - Lives system
  - Score tracking
- *Multiple entity types*: Player, enemies, platforms, collectibles
- *Modular system design*: Easy to extend with new systems and components


- Raspberry Pi Pico, Pico 2, or Pico 2W
- Pimoroni Display Pack 2.0 (320x240 ST7789 display with buttons)


### Controls

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| A | Move Left |
| B | Move Right |
| Y | Jump (press again in air for double jump) |
| X | Restart game (when game over) |

### ECS Architecture

#### Components

- *PositionComponent*: Entity position in world space
- *VelocityComponent*: Movement velocity
- *SpriteComponent*: Visual representation
- *PlayerComponent*: Player-specific state (lives, jumps)
- *ColliderComponent*: Collision box
- *PhysicsComponent*: Physics properties (gravity, friction)
- *EnemyComponent*: Enemy AI state (patrol range)
- *PlatformComponent*: Platform properties
- *CollectibleComponent*: Collectible items (coins)

#### Systems (Update Order)

1. *InputSystem*: Reads button input and controls player
2. *EnemyAISystem*: Updates enemy patrol behavior
3. *PhysicsSystem*: Applies gravity and updates positions
4. *CollisionSystem*: Detects and resolves collisions
5. *RenderSystem*: Draws everything to the display


### Building

#### Prerequisites

1. Install the Pico SDK:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
cd pico-sdk
git submodule update --init
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk
```

2. Install CMake and ARM toolchain:
```bash
sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi
```


#### Compile

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This generates `platformer.uf2` which you can drag-and-drop onto your Pico in BOOTSEL mode.


### Game Design

#### Level Layout

The game features:
- Ground platforms extending across the bottom
- Floating platforms at various heights
- Enemies patrolling between points
- Collectible coins scattered throughout
- Camera that follows the player


#### Gameplay Mechanics

*Movement*: 
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration
- Friction when no input is provided

*Jumping*:
- Variable height jump (based on button press duration)
- Double jump capability
- Only resets when landing on ground

*Enemies*:
- Patrol between defined points
- Can be defeated by jumping on top
- Cause damage if touched from the side
- Award 100 points when defeated

*Collectibles*:
- Award 50 points each
- Disappear when collected

*Game Over*:
- Player starts with 3 lives
- Lose life when hit by enemy
- Game over when lives reach 0
- Press X to restart


### Extending the Game

#### Adding New Entity Types

1. Define a new component type in `game.h`:
```c
typedef struct {
    // Your data here
} MyComponent;
```

2. Add component type enum value:
```c
enum ComponentType {
    // ...
    CT_MY_COMPONENT
};
```

3. Create entities with your component in `game_create_level()`.

#### Adding New Systems

1. Define system struct in `game.h`:
```c
typedef struct {
    System base;
    // System-specific data
} MySystem;
```

2. Implement update function in `game.c`:
```c
void my_system_update(System* self, World* world, float dt) {
    int required[] = {CT_MY_COMPONENT};
    Array entities = world_query(world, required, 1);
    // Process entities...
    array_free(&entities);
}
```

3. Add system to world in `game_init()`.

#### Adding Sprite Bitmaps

Edit `sprites.h` to add your bitmap data:
```c
static const uint8_t my_sprite[16] = {
    0b00111100,
    0b01111110,
    // ... more rows
};
```

Then update the SpriteComponent to use it:
```c
sprite.bitmap = my_sprite;
```

You'll also need to modify the render system to draw bitmap sprites instead of solid rectangles.


### Performance Optimisations

The game is optimized for the Pico's 133MHz ARM Cortex-M0+:

- *DMA transfers* for large display updates
- *Component type indexing* for fast entity queries
- *Spatial partitioning* possible for larger worlds
- *Fixed-point math* can replace floats if needed


### Troubleshooting

*Display not initializing*:
- Check SPI connections
- Verify Display Pack is properly seated
- Check power supply is adequate

*Choppy framerate*:
- Reduce entity count
- Optimize collision detection
- Lower target FPS in main.c

*Buttons not responding*:
- Ensure buttons_init() is called
- Check buttons_update() is in main loop
- Verify pull-up resistors are enabled


### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multiple levels with transitions
- [ ] Power-ups (invincibility, speed boost)
- [ ] Animated sprites
- [ ] Sound effects (via PWM buzzer)
- [ ] High score persistence (flash storage)
- [ ] Parallax scrolling background
- [ ] Boss battles
- [ ] Particle effects
