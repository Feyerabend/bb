## Temperature Measurements

Here we introduce temperature measurements using a Raspberry Pi Pico. The goal is to not only collect sensor
data but also explore algorithms that can be used to interpret and refine it. In particular, we examine Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) from the field of machine learning, Kalman filters for sensor fusion and noise reduction,
and fuzzy logic for approximate reasoning in uncertain environments. Read through the accompanying code to get
a sense of what these algorithms do, how they differ in approach, and how they can be applied to the same data
stream to produce meaningful interpretations and predictions.
