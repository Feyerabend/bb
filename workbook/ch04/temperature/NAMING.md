## Naming Conventions

The world of semiconductor naming might seem like a cryptic labyrinth of letters and
numbers at first, but beneath the surface lies a fascinating tapestry of logic, history,
and branding that tells the story of the chips powering our devices. From microcontrollers
to processors, sensors to memory chips, the names assigned to these tiny marvels of
engineering are far from random. They carry clues about the chip’s purpose, its manufacturer,
its technical specifications, and even its place in the broader timeline of technological
evolution. While there’s no universal standard for naming semiconductors-each company crafts
its own conventions-the patterns that emerge across the industry reveal a blend of practicality
marketing, and historical continuity.

At its core, a semiconductor’s name is a compact code, a shorthand designed to convey essential
information to engineers, hobbyists, and manufacturers. These names often hint at the chip’s
family or series, its function (whether it’s a microcontroller, a sensor, or a logic chip),
its technical specifications like voltage or packaging, and sometimes its revision or generation.
For example, the letters in a name might point to the manufacturer or the type of device, while
the numbers often indicate a model, sequence, or specific capability. Understanding these
codes is like learning a new language-one that unlocks the story of the chip and its role
in the broader ecosystem of electronics.


#### Z80
To get a sense of how this works, consider the iconic Z80, a microprocessor that emerged in
the 1970s from Zilog, a company founded by ex-Intel engineers. The "Z" proudly declares its
maker, Zilog, while the "80" nods to its predecessor, the Intel 8080, signaling compatibility
and a step forward in performance. This naming choice was partly technical and partly marketing
genius-by echoing the 8080, Zilog positioned the Z80 as a natural upgrade, a chip that could
slot into existing systems while offering enhanced capabilities. The Z80’s simple, memorable
name reflects the era it came from, when chip names were short, punchy, and tied closely to
their manufacturer’s identity or a numerical sequence.

#### Raspberry Pi Pico 2
The chip used in the RPI Pico 2 is called "RP2350". The numerical suffix "2350" follows a
structured, spec-driven code documented in Raspberry Pi's datasheet:
`RP + process node + revision + storage capacity`.

- `2`: Silicon process node (40nm), matching the RP2040 (familiar to us) for consistent efficiency,
 low power, and cost-ideal for battery-powered projects with faster I/O and integrated features.
- `3`: Chip revision/generation (third major iteration in the RP series; RP2040 was "0"), marking
 upgrades like dual Cortex-M33 cores (150MHz, with security and RISC-V options), 12 PIO state
 machines (up from 8), and enhanced peripherals for backward-compatible evolution.
- `50`: Non-volatile storage code (floor(log2(max NVM / 16KB)), supporting up to 16MB external
 flash or 2–4MB internal in variants like RP2350B), doubling SRAM/flash vs. RP2040 for complex
 apps like ML or secure boot.

#### BMP280, BMP680
Sensors, another key category of semiconductors, follow their own logic. The BMP280, a pressure and
temperature sensor from Bosch Sensortec, is a great example. The "BMP" stands for BaroMetric Pressure,
indicating its function, while "280" distinguishes it as a specific model in Bosch’s sensor family,
likely tied to its generation or precision. Similarly, the BME680, another Bosch sensor, extends
the naming convention to include environmental measurements like humidity and gas, with "680"
marking its place in the product line. These names are purpose-driven, with letters signaling the
manufacturer and sensor type, and numbers differentiating models based on features or revisions.

#### Patterns
Looking back at the history of semiconductor naming, patterns emerge that reflect the industry’s
evolution. In the 1960s and 1970s, chip names were often minimalist, like the famous 7400 series of
logic gates or the legendary 555 timer IC, both from Texas Instruments. These names were rooted in
manufacturer series numbers, designed for engineers who needed quick, reliable identifiers for
standardised components. Microprocessors from that era, like the Intel 8080 or MOS Technology’s 6502,
followed a similar logic, with names that referenced their predecessors or market sequence. The
simplicity of these names belied their significance-chips like the 6502 powered early personal
computers, from the Apple II to the Commodore 64, shaping the digital age.

#### STM32F103C8T6
Today’s naming conventions are more layered, reflecting the complexity of modern chips. Take the
STM32F103C8T6, a microcontroller from STMicroelectronics. The name is a mouthful, but it’s a treasure
trove of information. "STM32" identifies the family, a popular line of 32-bit microcontrollers.
"F1" denotes the series within that family, "03" specifies the model, "C8" indicates the flash memory
size, and "T6" describes the package type. This granular naming system allows engineers to pinpoint
exactly which chip suits their needs, from processing power to physical form factor. It’s a far cry
from the simplicity of a 555 timer, but it reflects the growing sophistication of electronics design.

#### Legacy
Even in modern naming, echoes of the past persist. Some chips retain legacy-style numbers for market
familiarity, like the 555 timer, still in use decades after its debut, or the ATmega328, a microcontroller
that powers many Arduino boards. The ATmega328’s name combines Atmel (the manufacturer, now part of
Microchip Technology) with "mega" for its family and "328" for its model, blending descriptive elements
with numerical shorthand. These legacy names endure because they’re ingrained in the engineering world,
a testament to the staying power of certain designs.

#### Decoding
The lack of a universal naming system can make semiconductors feel like a wild west of codes and conventions,
but this diversity is also a strength. Each manufacturer’s naming scheme reflects its brand, priorities,
and technical focus. Texas Instruments might lean on numerical sequences for its logic chips, while Bosch
uses descriptive acronyms for its sensors. Raspberry Pi opts for a mix of branding and internal logic,
and STMicroelectronics builds layered codes for maximum specificity. Once you crack the code of a particular
company’s naming style, the names start to feel less like gibberish and more like a roadmap to the chip’s
purpose and capabilities.

#### Datasheets
For those diving into electronics, datasheets are the Rosetta Stone for decoding semiconductor names. These
technical documents spell out what the letters and numbers mean, from the chip’s family and function to its
electrical characteristics and package type. By familiarizing yourself with a manufacturer’s naming
conventions-whether it’s STM, Bosch, or Raspberry Pi-you start to see the method behind the madness.
The names aren’t just arbitrary; they’re a compact history of the chip, its maker, and its place in the
ever-evolving world of technology.
