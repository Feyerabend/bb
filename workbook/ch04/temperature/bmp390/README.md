## BMP390

1. Read the calibration coefficients from the NVM registers.
2. Parse them into signed/unsigned integers as defined in the datasheet.
3. Apply Bosch's equations for temperature and pressure compensation.

This also examplifies a I2C connection.

### Barometric altitude — formula and notes

A common and practical approximation for altitude from pressure
is the international barometric formula:
```
h = 44330.77 * (1.0 - (P / P0) ** 0.190295)
```
where:
- `h` is altitude in metres,
- `P` is measured pressure in hPa,
- `P0` is reference sea-level pressure in hPa (default 1013.25 hPa).

Notes:
- Using the local current sea-level pressure (P0) gives far better altitude
  accuracy than the default 1013.25 hPa.
- This formula assumes a standard atmosphere and is suitable for typical
  hobbyist/weather uses. For precise elevation measurements you need local
  meteorological corrections.


*Notes*:
- Using the local current sea-level pressure (`P0`) significantly improves altitude accuracy.
  For the location of test in Uppsala, Sweden, on September 28, 2025, at 05:35 PM CEST,
  the sea-level pressure was approximately *1033 hPa* (based on Uppsala University station
  data at 4:00 PM, adjusted for minor diurnal variation).
- This formula assumes a standard atmosphere and is suitable for typical hobbyist or weather uses.
  For precise elevation measurements however, apply local meteorological corrections
  (e.g., temperature variations or weather fronts).
- At low altitudes (e.g., 0-100 m), pressure drops approximately *0.12 hPa per meter*,
  but this rate varies with temperature and weather conditions.


### MicroPython: Altitude Function

Returns altitude in meters from pressure (hPa).
- `p_hpa`: Measured pressure in hPa (e.g., value returned by `compensate_press` divided by 100).
- `p0_hpa`: Reference sea-level pressure in hPa (default 1013.25; set to 1033 for Uppsala accuracy).

```python
def altitude_from_pressure(p_hpa, p0_hpa=1013.25):
    # Avoid division by zero or negative pressures
    if p_hpa <= 0 or p0_hpa <= 0:
        return None
    return 44330.77 * (1.0 - (p_hpa / p0_hpa) ** 0.190295)
```

*Example Usage in the Main Loop* (after computing `press_hpa` in hPa):
```python
p0 = 1033.0  # Local sea-level pressure for Uppsala, September 28, 2025
alt = altitude_from_pressure(press_hpa, p0)
print("Altitude: {:.2f} m".format(alt))
```

__You have to calibrate these values to get even an approximate reading. Dig deeper!__

*Recommendation*: For your location, use the linear approximation or calibrate `p0_hpa` with a known elevation
(e.g., river level at 20 m ASL) to fine-tune results.



### Early aviation and "analog computers"

Before digital electronics, aircraft often relied on mechanical or analog computing
devices to derive altitude, airspeed, bombing trajectories, or firing solutions.

Barometric altitude (like the BMP390) was originally measured using a
*mechanical aneroid barometer*:
- A sealed metal capsule would expand/contract with changes in air pressure.
- That mechanical movement would drive gears and dials--giving a direct altitude readout.
- In principle, it was performing the same function as our formula:
  mapping air pressure to height, assuming a standard atmosphere.


#### Military applications (WWI-WWII era and after)

1. Altimeters:
- Standard aircraft altimeters were essentially analog computers for pressure.
- They assumed sea-level pressure = 1013.25 hPa unless the pilot adjusted the
  "Kollsman window" for local barometric pressure.
- Errors occurred if weather changed or if pressure wasn't set correctly.

2. Airspeed indicators:
- These also used pressure, comparing pitot tube (dynamic pressure) with
  static pressure from a port.
- The difference was mechanically converted into speed.

3. Bombsights & fire-control computers:
- Devices like the Norden bombsight in WWII combined barometric altitude,
  airspeed, wind correction, and ballistics in a purely analog way.
- Inside, there were gears, cams, and mechanical integrators that solved
  differential equations in real time--all based on continuous mechanical movement.

4. Naval and artillery fire-control computers:
- Similar technology but more elaborate: large electro-mechanical devices that
  continuously computed shell trajectories given bearing, range, wind, and ship motion.


#### Parallel with the BMP390 project

Reading pressure and turning it into altitude with an equation is exactly what those
early instruments did with springs, gears, and cams.
- The BMP390's silicon diaphragm is the equivalent of the old aneroid capsule.
- THe compensation math is what used to be embodied in carefully designed mechanical linkages.
- The difference is that now you can run it in digital code at kilohertz speeds and with
  much greater precision.
