## Tail Recusion

Tail recursion is a form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in a function before returning a result. This means that once the recursive call is made, there is no need to retain any previous state, as there are no pending operations to perform. Because of this property, some programming languages and compilers can optimise tail-recursive functions by reusing the same stack frame instead of creating a new one for each recursive call. This optimisation, known as tail call optimisation (TCO), allows tail-recursive functions to execute with constant memory usage, making them as efficient as loops in terms of space complexity. Tail recursion is particularly useful in cases where deep recursion would otherwise lead to stack overflow, and it encourages an iterative approach within a recursive structure by passing accumulated results through function parameters.

The sample is from the book, and descriptions can also be found there. Also see the folder [sch](../sch/) which describes more on tail recursion with an implementation of a partly Scheme-like interpreter.
