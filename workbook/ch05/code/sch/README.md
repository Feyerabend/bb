## Minimal Lisp Interpreters in C: Implementation and Evolution

These C code excerpts and markdown documents detail the implementation and evolution of
minimal Lisp interpreters. They illustrate the core data structures like lists and symbols,
fundamental interpreter components such as evaluation functions and environments, and key
Lisp concepts including first-class functions and special forms. The sources show a progression
from basic interpreters to more advanced versions incorporating memory management via object
pools and garbage collection, alongside attempts at tail recursion optimisation. Later
discussions reflect on limitations and suggest avenues for enhancement, such as improved
memory handling, error reporting, a richer standard library, and compilation techniques.

The core theme across all sources is the implementation of a foundational Lisp, or minimalist
Lisp (specifically Scheme-like), interpreter in C. The sources progressively build upon this
foundation, introducing some key Lisp concepts and addressing limitations.


### Key Concepts and Ideas


__1. Fundamental Lisp Data Structures__

- Symbolic Expressions (S-expressions): Lisp's fundamental data structure, where both code and
  data are represented as expressions.
- Lists: Implemented as linked lists using `struct LispList` with `car` (first element) and `cdr`
  (rest of the list). The cons function is used to construct these lists.
- Atoms: Basic data types, primarily numbers (`TYPE_NUMBER`) and symbols (`TYPE_SYMBOL`).
- Functions: Represented by `struct LispFunction`, distinguishing between built-in functions
  (implemented in C) and user-defined functions (lambda expressions).


__2. Interpreter Core Components__

- Object Types: An enumeration (`LispType`) defines the different types of Lisp objects
  (`NUMBER`, `SYMBOL`, `LIST`, `FUNCTION`).
- LispObject Structure: A `union` within `struct LispObject` allows a single object to hold
  different data types based on its type.
- Environment: (`struct Environment`) Manages variable bindings. It supports lexical scoping
  through parent environments.
- Evaluation (`eval` and `eval_tail_recursive`): The central function responsible for interpreting
  Lisp expressions. It handles different expression types:
    - Numbers evaluate to themselves.
    - Symbols are looked up in the environment.
    - Lists are treated as function calls or special forms (e.g. `quote`, `define`, `lambda`).
- Function Application (`apply_function`): Handles the execution of both built-in and user-defined
  functions. For user-defined functions, it creates a new environment with bound parameters.


__3. Special Forms:__

- `quote`: Returns its argument unevaluated.
- `define`: Binds a value to a symbol in the current environment.
- `lambda`: Creates anonymous functions (closures).

__4. Built-in Functions__

- The interpreters include basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`), conditional (`if`),
  equality check (`eq?`), and list manipulation (`list`, `map`, `reduce` in the more advanced version).
- These are implemented as C functions that operate on LispList arguments.


__5. Memory Management (Progressive Introduction)__

- Manual Allocation (`malloc`, `free`): Initial versions directly use malloc and free for object creation.
- Object Pool: Later versions introduce an ObjectPool to manage memory more efficiently,
  reducing the overhead of frequent allocations and deallocations.
- Garbage Collection (Mark and Sweep): The most advanced versions implement a mark-and-sweep garbage
  collector to automatically reclaim unused memory.
    - Mark Phase (`mark`, `mark_environment`): Identifies reachable objects starting from the environment.
    - Sweep Phase (`sweep`): Frees unmarked (unreachable) objects in the object pool.


__6. Tail Recursion Optimisation__

- The eval_tail_recursive function attempts to optimise tail-recursive calls to prevent stack overflow.
  (The 'continue' keyword in the eval_tail_recursive function demonstrates this.)


### Conclusion

These sources collectively provide a valuable insight into the implementation of a minimalist Lisp
interpreter in C. They illustrate the core data structures, evaluation mechanisms, and the gradual
introduction of more advanced features like garbage collection and tail recursion optimisation. The
final markdown document ("SCHEM.md") serves as a critical reflection, highlighting the limitations
of the current implementation and suggesting potential avenues for further development, such as
improved memory management, error handling, a richer standard library, and even compilation techniques.
The journey from basic allocation to garbage collection showcases the complexities and trade-offs
involved in building even a small language interpreter.
