## Three Address Code (TAC)

Besides expressions, a complete TAC representation also includes constructs for control flow,
function calls, memory management, and other programming features.

__1. Basic Concepts__

- Instruction Format: Each TAC instruction has at most three operands:
  * `x = y op z` (binary operation)
  * `x = op y` (unary operation)
  * `x = y` (assignment)
- Temporary Variables: Intermediate results are stored in temporary variables, usually denoted as t1, t2, etc.
- Labels: Used to denote targets for jumps and branches.


__2. Representing Expressions__

TAC can represent arithmetic, logical, and relational expressions:
- Arithmetic: `t1 = a + b`
- Logical: `t2 = a && b`
- Relational: `t3 = a < b`

Example:

```assembly
t1 = x + y
t2 = t1 * z
result = t2
```

__3. Conditional Branching__

TAC supports conditional statements using comparisons and jumps:
- `if-goto`: Conditional jump to a label if a condition is true.
- `goto`: Unconditional jump to a label.

Example (if-else):

```assembly
t1 = x < 10
if t1 goto label_1
y = y + 1
goto label_2
label_1:
y = y - 1
label_2:
```

__4. Loops__

Loops are represented using labels and jumps:
- While Loop:

```assembly
label_1:
t1 = x < 10
if not t1 goto label_2
x = x + 1
goto label_1
label_2:
```

- For Loop:

```assembly
i = 0
label_1:
t1 = i < 10
if not t1 goto label_2
body_of_loop
i = i + 1
goto label_1
label_2:
```

__5. Function Calls__

TAC handles function calls with param, call, and return instructions:
- `param`: Push a parameter onto the call stack.
- `call`: Invoke a function with a specified number of parameters.
- `return`: Return a value from a function.

Example (function call):

```assembly
param a
param b
call add, 2  # Call `add` with 2 parameters
result = t1  # Capture the return value in `result`
```

__6. Arrays and Memory__

TAC can represent arrays and memory access:
- Array Access:
  - Read: `t1 = arr[i]`
  - Write: `arr[i] = t2`
- Pointers:
  - Dereference: `t3 = *p`
  - Address-of: `p = &x`

Example:

```assembly
t1 = arr[i]
t2 = t1 + 1
arr[i] = t2
```

__7. Object-Oriented Features__

For object-oriented languages, TAC can represent method calls and member access:
- Member Access: `t1 = obj.field`
- Method Calls: `t2 = obj.method()`

Example:

```assembly
param obj
call obj.method, 1
t1 = t2  # Capture the return value
```

__8. Error Handling__

Control flow for exceptions can be represented using labels and jumps:

```assembly
label_try:
t1 = x / y
goto label_end
label_catch:
t2 = "Division by zero"
goto label_end
label_end:
```

__9. Advanced Features__

Phi Functions (for SSA): To handle merging variables at control flow joins.

```assembly
t1 = phi(x1, x2)
```

Inline Assembly: To include specific low-level instructions directly.


### Example: Full TAC Program

Hereâ€™s a TAC representation of a simple program:

```c
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

TAC Representation:

```assembly
label factorial:
param n
t1 = n <= 1
if t1 goto label_base_case
t2 = n - 1
param t2
call factorial, 1
t3 = t2 * n
return t3
label_base_case:
return 1
```

Benefits of TAC
- Simplified Analysis: Easier for compilers to analyze, optimize, and generate machine code.
- Portability: Language-neutral representation simplifies targeting multiple architectures.
- Optimisation: Enables techniques like dead-code elimination, constant folding, and register allocation.



### Annotated TAC

Annotated Three-Address Code (TAC) enhances plain TAC by including additional metadata and structure.
This version is more programmatically accessible, allowing for easier integration into compilers,
interpreters, or analysis tools. While the annotated TAC format differs slightly from plain TAC, it
represents the same underlying logic.

#### EBNF

```ebnf
program           = { statement } ;
statement         = assignment 
                  | if_statement 
                  | goto_statement 
                  | label 
                  | print_statement 
                  | function_call 
                  | return_statement 
                  | halt_statement ;
assignment        = identifier "=" expression ;
expression        = term [ operator term ] ;
term              = identifier | number ;
operator          = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "&&" | "||" ;
condition         = "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "==" | "!=" ;
if_statement      = "if" condition "goto" label ;
goto_statement    = "goto" label ;
label             = "label" identifier ":" ;
print_statement   = "print" identifier ;
function_call     = "call" identifier "," number ;
return_statement  = "return" [ identifier | number ] ;
halt_statement    = "halt" ;
identifier        = letter { letter | digit | "_" } ;
number            = digit { digit } ;
```

#### Example: Factorial Program

Here is an example of a factorial program written in annotated TAC:

```python
factorial_program = [
    {"type": "label", "identifier": "start"},
    {"type": "assignment", "dest": "n", "rhs": {"type": "term", "value": "5"}},  # 5! = 120
    {"type": "assignment", "dest": "result", "rhs": {"type": "term", "value": "1"}},
    {"type": "label", "identifier": "loop"},
    {"type": "if", "condition": {
        "type": "binary_op",
        "left": {"type": "term", "value": "n"},
        "operator": "<=",
        "right": {"type": "term", "value": "0"}
    }, "label": "end"},
    {"type": "assignment", "dest": "result", "rhs": {
        "type": "binary_op",
        "left": {"type": "term", "value": "result"},
        "operator": "*",
        "right": {"type": "term", "value": "n"}
    }},
    {"type": "assignment", "dest": "n", "rhs": {
        "type": "binary_op",
        "left": {"type": "term", "value": "n"},
        "operator": "-",
        "right": {"type": "term", "value": "1"}
    }},
    {"type": "goto", "label": "loop"},
    {"type": "label", "identifier": "end"},
    {"type": "print", "value": "result"},
    {"type": "halt"},
]
```

#### Equivalent Plain TAC Representation

The annotated TAC program can be translated into plain TAC, which is closer to traditional assembly-like syntax:

```assembly
label start:
n = 5
result = 1
label loop:
if n <= 0 goto end
result = result * n
n = n - 1
goto loop
label end:
print result
halt
```

Improvements in the Annotated TAC
1. *Explicit Metadata*: Each statement includes its type, allowing for direct parsing and understanding.
2. *Structured Conditions*: Conditions are represented as binary operations, making them easier to evaluate programmatically.
3. *Semantic Clarity*: Labels, assignments, and operations are well-defined, reducing ambiguity.
4. *Enhanced Debugging*: Metadata and structured fields simplify error tracing and debugging.

This annotated TAC format offers an intuitive way to model and manipulate programs while retaining compatibility
with the simpler plain TAC representation above.
