## Some Historical Remarks on Parsing

Parsing in computing refers to the process of analysing a sequence of symbols, often in the form of text or code,
to determine its grammatical structure based on formal rules. The history of parsing is deeply rooted in the development
of formal languages and computation, with key milestones that shaped its role in programming and computer science.

The origins of parsing trace back to the 1940s and 1950s, during the early days of computing when the foundations of
formal languages were laid by mathematicians such as Alan Turing and Noam Chomsky. Turing's work on computation and
his introduction of the Turing machine played a critical role in the development of automata theory, which forms
the basis for parsing. In the 1950s, Chomsky introduced his hierarchy of grammars, categorising them into regular,
context-free, context-sensitive, and recursively enumerable types. These classifications continue to influence
parsing techniques used today.

In the early days of programming, parsing was often done manually or using rudimentary techniques, especially in
the context of assembly languages and the first high-level languages like Fortran. As programming languages evolved,
the need for automatic translation of human-readable code into machine instructions became essential, giving rise
to the development of more sophisticated parsing methods. The concept of context-free grammars (CFGs) emerged as
a significant step forward, enabling more structured and automated parsing of code. These grammars could be processed
by [pushdown automata](./pushdown), a theoretical machine model that handles context-free languages efficiently.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the rise of compilers led to more formalised parsing methods. The development of recursive
descent parsers and top-down parsing methods like LL parsers allowed for simple context-free grammars to be handled
efficiently. However, it was the introduction of LR parsers in the 1970s by Donald Knuth that marked a major advancement
in the field. LR parsers, which read input from left to right and produce a rightmost derivation, made it possible to
parse more complex grammars. This breakthrough was followed by the introduction of LALR parsers (Look-Ahead LR), which
offered greater efficiency while handling a larger subset of context-free grammars.

By the 1980s and 1990s, parsing techniques became more accessible, particularly with the advent of tools like Yacc
(Yet Another Compiler Compiler) and Bison, which allowed developers to generate parsers from formal grammar definitions.
These tools played a pivotal role in the growth of compiler construction and parsing in general, making the process
of writing parsers more systematic and less error-prone. This period also saw the rise of abstract syntax trees (ASTs),
a data structure that provides a more intuitive and compact representation of a program's syntax, which was particularly
useful for later stages of compilation or interpretation.

In the 2000s and beyond, parsing evolved alongside the growth of web technologies and the increasing need to parse
[data formats](./data) like JSON and XML. Modern parsing libraries such as ANTLR provided more flexible and powerful
tools for parsing not just programming languages but also structured data used in various applications. Error handling
and recovery mechanisms also improved, leading to more robust parsers that can provide helpful feedback to developers,
especially in integrated development environments (IDEs).

Today, parsing is no longer limited to programming languages and compilers. It plays a crucial role in web development,
data processing, and many other domains that involve structured text. From parsing source code and configuration files
to processing JSON data and markup languages, parsing remains a foundational component of modern computing. Its history
reflects the ongoing efforts to automate and optimise the way machines interpret human-readable information.
