## XML Parser in C


### 1. Tokenization

In parsing theory, tokenization (or lexical analysis) is the process of breaking input into meaningful units (tokens).
The parse_tag function mimics this by extracting tokens like the tag name, attributes, and values from the XML input.
For instance, `<book>` is a tag token, and `title="C Programming"` is further decomposed into attribute tokens.


### 2. Context-Free Grammar (CFG)

XML is a context-free language, which means its structure can be described using context-free grammars. For example:

```enbf
    tag ::= '<' name (attribute)* '>' '</' name '>'
    attribute ::= name '=' '"' value '"'
```

This code handles a subset of this grammar, focusing on opening tags, their attributes, and closing tags. However,
it doesn't validate the nesting of tags, which would require more sophisticated grammar handling (like a pushdown automaton).

Moreover, it doesn't handle the self-closing tag or empty-element (e.g. `</tag>`.)


### 3. Parsing Strategy

*Recursive Descent Parsing*:
While not implemented as a recursive parser, the function mimics aspects of recursive descent parsing by processing XML input
sequentially and identifying tags and attributes in a structured manner.

*Finite-State Machine*:
The `inside_tag` flag and character-by-character processing simulate a state machine where the parser transitions between
states such as "outside a tag," "inside a tag," and "processing attributes."


### 4. Error Handling and Robustness

Parsing theory often emphasizes error handling, such as detecting malformed input. The parser doesn't yet check for *invalid
XML* (e.g. missing quotes or unmatched tags), which would align with theory-driven strategies for error detection and recovery.


### 5. Parse Tree Construction

Parsing theory often involves building a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) to represent the structure of the input.
The code here partially constructs this in the form of a 'Tag' structure, which captures tag names and their attributes but omits
*hierarchical nesting* or *content between tags*.


### 6. Simplifications
The parser assumes well-formed XML (e.g. tags are properly closed, attributes are quoted). In parsing theory, this corresponds
to operating on an unambiguous grammar, which simplifies the implementation.


### Improving the Parser

*Project: Improve on the parser, to handle more than purely basic XML.*

*Practical Adaptation*: The code simplifies theoretical concepts for practical use, handling basic tokenization and parsing
but avoiding complex grammar constructs like nested tags or mixed content.
	
*Efficiency*: The parser processes input in a single pass (linear time complexity), demonstrating a trade-off between simplicity
and completeness. Parsing theory often seeks to optimize performance for specific grammars, as your code does for basic XML.
	
*Scope*: It focuses on syntactic parsing (structure), *not* semantic validation (e.g. ensuring that attribute values are meaningful
or that tag names are allowed).

1. *Handle Nested Tags*:
   Add support for hierarchical structures by maintaining a stack of open tags. This aligns with parsing theoryâ€™s
   'pushdown automaton' approach for context-free languages.

2. *Error Detection*:
   Implement error checks for mismatched tags, missing attributes, or unclosed quotes. Parsing theory often includes
   techniques for error recovery in such cases.

3. *Validation Against Grammar*:
   Integrate XML schema validation or DTD checks, aligning with formal grammar verification.

4. *Parse Tree Construction*:
   Build a tree representation of the XML document, which is standard in theoretical parsing to represent input hierarchies.


### Summary

This XML parser is a practical, minimal implementation inspired by parsing theory. It demonstrates key concepts
like tokenization, state transitions, and partial tree construction. Expanding it to handle nested structures,
validation, and error recovery would further align it with formal parsing theory while making it more robust.
