## Parsers Overview

Parsers represent a broad and foundational area within computer science and related disciplines, having
evolved significantly over time. In this discussion, we focus on a select aspect of their [history](HISTORY.md),
highlighting their application and relevance, particularly in the context of computer languages.

Production rules are the formal constructs in a grammar that define the syntactic structure of a language.
They specify how symbols in the language can be generated or replaced during parsing. Each production rule
maps a non-terminal symbol to a sequence of terminal and/or non-terminal symbols, describing a valid
transformation within the grammar.

The general form of a production rule is:

```text
    A → α
```

Here, `A` is a non-terminal symbol (representing a syntactic category), and `α` is a sequence of terminals
(actual symbols of the language) and/or non-terminals (further rules). The left-hand side (`A`) indicates
what is being defined, and the right-hand side (`α`) specifies how it can be expanded.

For example, in a grammar for simple arithmetic expressions:

```text
    Expr → Expr + Term
    Expr → Term
    Term → Number
    Number → 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 9
```

These rules define how complex expressions like `3 + 5` can be decomposed into their basic components
(numbers, operators) and parsed accordingly.

See some [simple](./simple) explanation of these basic steps: from a textual input to a representation of
the input in data structures that can be processed by the computer (a parse tree or AST).


### Top-Down Parsers

These parsers start from the start symbol of the grammar and attempt to derive the input string by applying production rules.
1. LL Parsers:
    - The abbreviation stands for `Left-to-right parsing, Leftmost derivation`.
	- They process the input from left to right and produce a leftmost derivation of the input string.
	- LL(k): This means the parser looks ahead k tokens to make decisions.
	- LL(1): The most common variant where only one token of lookahead is used.
	- Works well for grammars without ambiguity, left recursion, or significant ambiguity in production choices.
	- Recursive Descent Parsers (discussed further below) are typically implemented as LL(1) parsers.

2. Recursive Descent Parsing:
	- A simple top-down parsing method where each non-terminal in the grammar is implemented as a recursive function.
	- Relies on LL(1) grammar for correctness.
	- It's intuitive and easy to implement but requires that the grammar avoids left recursion and excessive ambiguity.

3. Predictive Parsing:
	- A non-recursive approach to LL parsing that uses a predictive table to guide parsing decisions.
	- Efficient for LL(1) grammars and avoids the need for recursive calls.


### Bottom-Up Parsers

These parsers start with the input tokens and attempt to reconstruct the start symbol of the grammar by reversing derivations.
1. LR Parsers:
	- The abbreviation stands for `Left-to-right parsing, Rightmost derivation in reverse`.
	- They process the input from left to right and construct a parse tree for a rightmost derivation in reverse.
	- Suitable for a broader class of grammars compared to LL parsers.

2. LR Variants:
	- SLR (Simple LR): Simplifies parsing by using a basic lookahead to resolve conflicts but works for a restricted set of grammars.
	- LALR (Lookahead LR): Combines states with identical cores to create a smaller parsing table, making it more memory-efficient
      than LR(1) while still supporting most programming language grammars.
	- LR(1): Uses a single lookahead token, supports a wide range of grammars, but parsing tables can become large.
	- GLR (Generalized LR): Handles non-deterministic or ambiguous grammars using parallel parsing paths.

3. Operator-Precedence Parsers:
	- A specific kind of bottom-up parser used for grammars where the structure is defined by operator precedence rules.
	- Simpler than full LR parsers but limited to certain grammars.


### Selected Parsing Techniques

1. [Combinatorial](./combinator) Parsing:
	- A functional programming approach to parsing where parsers are functions that can be combined in modular ways to recognize grammar constructs.
	- Often implemented in languages like Haskell or Scala.
	- Elegant, flexible, and well-suited to highly modular or complex grammar constructs.
	- More commonly used in small domain-specific languages rather than general-purpose compilers due to potential inefficiency.

2. [Earley](./earley) Parser:
	- A general parsing technique for any context-free grammar.
    - Suitable for ambiguous grammars but slower compared to LL and LR parsers for regular use.

3. [Metcalfe](./metcalfe) Parser:
	- Through a separate program, can it parse a diverse set of grammars which makes it reprogrammable.
	- Useful in educational purposes as it is easy to understand the principles of parsing.

4. [LL(1)](./LL1) Parsing:
	- Strengths: Easy to implement, efficient for simple grammars, and guarantees linear parsing time for LL(1) grammars.
	- Limitations: Cannot handle left-recursive or ambiguous grammars. Requires careful grammar design to fit LL(1) constraints.
	- Uses a parsing table for predictive parsing, where each cell indicates which production to apply based on the current input token and non-terminal.

5. [Recursive Descent](./simple) Parsing:
	- Implements each grammar rule as a function, where non-terminals are recursive calls.
	- Parsing decisions are guided by lookahead (one token ahead in LL(1)).
	- Direct and clear for grammar constructs, making it excellent for prototyping parsers.
