## A Simple Compiler: Dead Code Elimination (DCE)

Dead Code Elimination (DCE) is an optimisation technique in compiler design and code analysis where
sections of code that do not affect the program's outcome are identified and removed. These "dead"
code segments typically include variables, functions, or expressions that are never used or whose
results are never observed.

The primary goal of dead code elimination is to improve the efficiency and readability of a program.
Removing unnecessary code reduces the size of the compiled output, leading to faster execution, less
memory consumption, and simpler maintenance. In addition to improving performance, eliminating dead
code can also reduce potential points of error and ambiguity in code.
