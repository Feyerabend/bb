## The Compiler Pipeline

This repository is a comprehensive and thoughtfully structured toolkit for language
processing and compiler construction. It brings together a wide range of implementations,
tools, and educational examples, offering both a practical foundation for building
language tools and a pedagogical guide to understanding the intricacies of compiler design.

At the core of the repository is a broad collection of parser implementations, spanning
multiple parsing strategies. These include traditional tokenisers and lexer generators
built on finite state machines, top-down approaches such as LL(1) and recursive descent,
and bottom-up strategies including LR and operator-precedence parsing. More advanced
techniques are also covered, with examples of Earley parsing, packrat parsers for PEG
grammars, and combinator-based frameworks. Tools for grammar transformation and analysis,
such as the Metcalfe parser framework, provide additional support for language engineers.

Building on these parsers, the repository includes full compiler infrastructures with
examples that walk through the entire pipeline--from lexical analysis and parsing through
to code generation. Intermediate representations such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs)
and three-address code (TAC) are used extensively, and backends targeting real architectures
like RISC-V and ARM demonstrate how high-level language constructs are lowered to machine-level
operations. Optimisations such as SSA transformation, DAG-based simplification, and dead
code elimination are explored. In addition, several virtual machines are implemented, 
ncluding models based on SECD, WAM, and PL/0, offering insight into runtime execution
strategies.

The repository also emphasizes language semantics, providing implementations of type systems,
symbol table construction and management, semantic checking tools, and the generation of
low-level intermediate code. These components are important in bridging the gap between
syntax and executable behavior, and they are well-integrated with the parsing and
compilation phases.

To support learning, the repository includes several educational language implementations,
most notably a series of progressively developed Pascal-like languages. These examples
range from minimal lexers to complete compilers and are accompanied by test cases,
sample programs, and supporting tools such as AST visualisers and symbol table inspectors.
A parallel line of development focuses on the PL/0 language, which is explored through
multiple interpreter variants and compilation strategies.

Complementing these components are several support libraries and runtime systems, including
object models and virtual method tables (vtables), as well as reusable modules for parsing,
error handling, and reporting. Documentation throughout the repository reflects best
practices in language design and compiler architecture, and includes curated reference
materials to deepen theoretical understanding.

The technical design of the repository is marked by a clear separation of compiler phases,
a multi-language implementation approach (primarily Python and C), and a consistent emphasis
on intermediate representations and their transformations. The examples are crafted with
a progressive learning structure, allowing users to start with simpler systems and gradually
engage with more complex compilation techniques. Visualisation tools embedded in the repository
further aid understanding by making abstract processes such as parsing and symbol resolution
more concrete.

Altogether, this repository functions both as a practical engineering toolkit for building
compilers and interpreters, and as a deeply educational resource for those seeking to
understand the theory and practice of programming language implementation.
It is particularly valuable for its end-to-end demonstrations of how source languages are
transformed into executable code, with a strong focus on intermediate stages and
semantic correctness.
