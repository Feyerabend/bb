## Project: Merge logic and tests?

*Project: Investigate the integration of theory and practice to develop programs
reflecting new paradigms inspired by TDD and logical correctness.*

Remember, the following are merely fragmented thoughts I’ve been pondering. They may
be entirely incorrect or flawed, or they might touch on something worth considering.
Either way, I encourage you to investigate or explore ideas like this *on your own*.
There is no absolute "right" or "wrong" in this context—only perspectives that may be
more or less productive, insightful, or applicable depending on the circumstances.

The value in questioning and reflecting on ideas lies not in arriving at a definitive
truth but in uncovering new angles, challenging assumptions, and opening doors to
creativity and understanding. Whether you agree, disagree, or refine these thoughts
into your own conclusions, the process of exploration itself is invaluable.


## Experimental Simulation

This project explores how preconditions, postconditions, and constraints can be integrated
into a virtual machine, creating a system where correctness criteria are inherent to the
programming process. The approach draws from a blend of ideas, blending inspiration from
*Test-Driven Development* (TDD) with principles of logic and formal verification.

TDD is a methodology centered on writing tests before developing the corresponding program
code. These tests, external to the program, serve as scaffolding to guide development and
validation. This separation of concerns—where tests operate independently of the program
they evaluate—offers critical advantages, such as maintaining minimal interference during
execution and providing a robust validation framework.

In contrast, *preconditions* and *postconditions*, rooted in formal logic and exemplified by
Hoare logic, represent a different perspective. Instead of relying on external tests,
they embed correctness specifications directly into the program itself. Preconditions
define what must hold true before a computation begins, and postconditions define what
must hold true afterward. Together with constraints, they provide a rigorous framework
for verifying program correctness at the logical level.

While TDD and logic-based correctness are distinct, this project proposes investigating
how aspects of these paradigms might influence each other. Could principles of TDD,
such as iterative refinement and continuous validation, inspire new ways to design
systems with embedded logical correctness? Conversely, could embedding preconditions
and postconditions provide insights into automating or augmenting the test-writing
process inherent to TDD?

Testing identifies problems and improves reliability but does not guarantee perfection.
Logic-based methods on the other hand can theoretically ensure correctness but are not
universally applicable or scalable.

To explore these questions, the project focuses on two key areas: integrating constraints
into programming languages and implementing preconditions and postconditions. These
mechanisms aim to create programs that are not only functionally correct but also capable
of adapting dynamically within well-defined logical boundaries.


### Suggested Projects

*  Introducing a language feature or virtual machine mechanism that combines runtime pre/postconditions
   with compile-time checks that could enforce correctness without significant runtime overhead.
   The compile-time component could use static analysis or symbolic execution to verify contracts ahead
   of execution.

*  Instead of fully embracing dependent types (which may be complex for general use), languages could
   adopt "lightweight" dependent types or enhanced contracts. For example, a VM could enforce that
   functions take inputs matching certain patterns or conditions and return outputs that meet defined
   criteria.

*  By embedding constraints directly in a language, these specifications could also serve as documentation,
   making the program easier to understand and debug. This approach aligns with the philosophy of
   *executable specifications*.

*  Investigate how these ideas could scale to real-world applications. Embedding contracts and constraints
   into large, distributed systems that could provide stronger guarantees in critical systems like financial
   services, aerospace, or healthcare.

This vision pushes the boundaries of programming language design. By experimenting within the controlled
environment of a VM, you can validate these ideas and offer insights that might shape the future of
programming paradigms. Maybe you could build your own experimental language!

Speaking of "contracts" above, check out the programming language Eiffel. Eiffel[^eiffel] is an object-oriented
programming language created by Bertrand Meyer in the late 1980s. It is designed with a focus on software
reliability, reusability, and maintainability. Eiffel's key feature is its strong emphasis on
*Design by Contract* (DbC), which helps developers create software with clearly defined responsibilities
and guarantees, leading to fewer bugs and more reliable code.

### Constraints and Hoare Logic

Constraints in programming act as rules or conditions that restrict the permissible states and operations
within a program. By enforcing constraints, we ensure that programs operate within predefined limits,
reducing bugs and unexpected behavior. These constraints can simulate dependent types, where the type of
a value depends on its context or other values, offering a richer framework for expressing program
invariants.

Hoare logic, introduced by C.A.R. Hoare in 1969[^hoare], provides a formal system for reasoning about
*program correctness*. Central to Hoare logic are Hoare triples of the form '{P} C {Q}', where:
- P is the precondition, a statement about the program's state before execution.
- C is the command or sequence of instructions.
- Q is the postcondition, a statement about the program's state after execution.

[^hoare]: Hoare, C.A.R. (1969). "An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming"
*Communications of the ACM* (October 1969) pp. 576-583.


These constructs allow developers to verify programs by proving that if P holds before C executes,
then Q will hold afterward—assuming C is correctly implemented. Hoare logic forms the foundation
for modern formal verification methods and tools, enabling precise reasoning about software behavior.

By combining constraints and Hoare logic, we gain an approach to designing kind of robust programs.
Constraints enforce real-time checks during execution, while Hoare logic provides a static framework
for formal reasoning, ensuring correctness from both dynamic and static perspectives.

#### Details of sample

1. Precondition Check (CHECK_PRECONDITION): The program checks that 'x' exists
   in memory, and since it's predefined, the precondition passes.

2. Load Variable (LOAD x): The value 5 is loaded from memory and pushed onto the
   stack, so the stack becomes [5].

3. Postcondition Check (CHECK_POSTCONDITION): The program checks that the stack
   is not empty after the LOAD operation, which passes because the stack has 5 on it.

4. Push Empty List (PUSH_LIST): A new empty list is created and pushed onto the
   stack, resulting in the stack becoming [5, []].

5. Append to List (APPEND): The program correctly pops the value (5) and the list
   ([]), appends the value to the list, and pushes the updated list ([5]) back
   onto the stack. After this operation, the stack is [5].

6. Store List (STORE lst): The list [5] is stored in memory under the variable 'lst'.

7. Precondition Check for 'lst': The program checks that 'lst' exists in memory,
   which passes because it was stored previously.

8. Load Variables (LOAD x and LOAD lst): The value 5 is loaded from 'x', and the
   list [5] is loaded from 'lst'. These are pushed onto the stack, so the stack becomes [5, [5]].

9. Push Index (PUSH 0): The index 0 is pushed onto the stack, making the stack [5, [5], 0].

10. Indexing the List (INDEX): The program pops the list ([5]) and the index (0), and
    successfully retrieves the value at index 0, which is 5. This value is pushed onto
    the stack, so the stack becomes [5, 5].

11. Postcondition Check: The program checks that the top value of the stack is an integer,
    which is true since the top value is 5.

12. Addition (ADD): The program pops two values (5 and 5), adds them together, and pushes
    the result (10) onto the stack. The stack is now [10].

13. Halt (HALT): The program halts, and the final stack is [10].


##### Final Output:
- Final Stack: [10]
- Memory: {'x': 5, 'lst': [5]}


##### Summary
- The program executes successfully and manipulates the stack and memory as expected.
- The APPEND operation, list indexing, and addition all work correctly.
- The checks for preconditions and postconditions are handled properly.


### Dependent Types

Let us delve deeper into theoretical constructs by exploring “dependent types.”
Dependent types allow types to depend on values, enabling more precise constraints
about data—-such as a list type that includes its length as part of its definition.
Although this program does not employ a formal dependent type system, it *simulates*
their behavior by incorporating *preconditions* and *postconditions*. These act
as constraints on data types and values manipulated during execution, echoing
the principles of dependent types. Languages like Agda, Coq, and Idris fully
implement dependent types, while Eiffel draws inspiration from Hoare logic to
incorporate contract-based programming. To be more precise, the distinction
between simulating dependent types and using contracts like preconditions and postconditions,
the latter are *runtime checks*, while dependent types typically enforce constraints
at *compile-time*. Here, this distinction is not enforced.

In our program, the dependent conditions are encoded in the form of lambdas passed as arguments
to the `CHECK_PRECONDITION` and `CHECK_POSTCONDITION` operations. These conditions rely on the
current state of the program (like the stack or memory), and the types or values of the data in
the stack or memory influence the behavior of the program.


### Constraints (Preconditions and Postconditions)

The constraints in the program are essentially conditions that must be met before or after
executing an operation. These conditions ensure that the program operates correctly and avoids
errors. The constraints can be thought of as properties or conditions that must hold true at
certain points of execution.

1.	Preconditions:
    - A precondition is a condition that must hold *true* *before* an operation can be executed.
      If the precondition is not met, the operation is not executed and an exception is raised.
	- Example: In the instruction `CHECK_PRECONDITION(lambda vm: 'x' in vm.memory)`, the precondition
      is checking that the variable 'x' exists in memory before proceeding with further instructions.
      This is a form of *dependent constraint*, where the condition depends on the current state
      of memory.

2.	Postconditions:
	- A postcondition is a condition that must hold true after an operation is executed. It
      ensures that the operation has had the intended effect on the system's state.
	- Example: In the instruction `CHECK_POSTCONDITION(lambda vm: len(vm.stack) > 0)`, the
      postcondition is checking that the stack is not empty after loading the value of 'x'.
      This ensures that the load operation has added something meaningful to the stack.


### How Dependent Types and Constraints are encoded in the program

1.	Memory and Variables:
	- The memory (`self.memory`) can be thought of as a collection of variables that
      have specific types. The constraints on how those variables can be used are enforced
      by the preconditions and postconditions.
	- For instance, the program ensures that 'x' must be present in memory before loading
      it (`CHECK_PRECONDITION(lambda vm: 'x' in vm.memory)`), which simulates a dependent
      constraint on the variable's existence before it can be used.

2.	Stack and Type Safety:
	- The stack (`self.stack`) holds intermediate values, and the program imposes type
      constraints on these values through the preconditions and postconditions. For example:
	- Before appending: In the APPEND operation, the program checks that the first element
      popped off the stack is a list. This simulates a dependent type check, where the type
      of the stack item is dependent on the operation that follows.
	- Before adding: The ADD operation assumes that the two popped items are integers. If
      the types don't match, the program would raise an error, enforcing a constraint on
      the types of the operands.
	- In this way, the program relies on runtime-dependent constraints to enforce type
      correctness and prevent errors during execution.

3.	Indexing the List:
	- The INDEX operation involves accessing an element from a list using an index. The
      program checks that the element being accessed is a valid list and that the index
      is within bounds. These checks represent constraints that depend on the current
      state of the stack and memory.
	- The program enforces a dependent type constraint by ensuring that the list is
      correctly indexed (i.e. it has the expected type of list and that the index is valid).



### Step-by-Step in terms of Constraints


__Step 1: CHECK_PRECONDITION for 'x'__

- Constraint: 'x' must exist in memory.
- Dependent type-like behavior: The program can only proceed with operations that use 'x'
  if it exists in memory. This is a value-dependent type constraint: we need the value of
  'x' to be available in memory, and the program is dependent on this for the next operation
  (LOAD x).

__Step 2: LOAD x__

- The program loads the value of 'x' (which is 5) onto the stack. This operation assumes that
  'x' is an integer, and the precondition checks ensure that the program will only perform
  this operation if the variable exists in memory.

__Step 3: CHECK_POSTCONDITION after loading 'x'__

- Constraint: The stack must not be empty.
- Dependent type-like behavior: The postcondition depends on the state of the stack. The program
  guarantees that after LOAD, the stack will contain at least one value.

__Step 4: PUSH_LIST__

- A new empty list is created and pushed onto the stack. The type of the item pushed onto the
  stack is list, and the stack is expected to hold this list type.

__Step 5: APPEND__

- The program ensures that the first pop is a list and the second pop is a value. The operation
  depends on these types, so it's a dependent type check where the stack must contain a list and
  a value in a specific order. The APPEND operation cannot proceed unless this condition holds.

__Step 6: STORE lst__

- The list [5] is stored in memory under the variable 'lst'. The constraint here is that the list
  must be stored under the correct name.

__Step 7: CHECK_PRECONDITION for 'lst'__

- Constraint: 'lst' must exist in memory before it can be loaded. This ensures that any subsequent
  use of 'lst' is valid.

__Step 8: LOAD lst__

- The list [5] is loaded from memory and pushed onto the stack. The operation assumes that 'lst'
  contains a list.

__Step 9: PUSH 0 and INDEX__

- Constraint: The list must be accessed with a valid index. The program checks that the index is
  a valid integer and that it corresponds to a valid position in the list. The type of the index
  (int) is a dependent constraint here.

__Step 10: ADD__

- The program pops two integers and adds them. The types of the popped items are dependent on the
  context: they must be integers, and this type is enforced by the operations.

__Step 11: HALT__

- The program halts, having successfully executed the operations with all constraints met.


### Conclusion

In this program, we simulate dependent types and constraints using preconditions and postconditions
to enforce type safety and correctness at runtime. While we *don't* have a formal dependent type system,
the checks on stack contents, memory variables, and types are *conceptually* *similar* to the way dependent
types ensure that programs respect their own type rules based on the values of variables. Each operation's
*'correctness'* depends on the current state of the stack and memory, which is what makes these checks akin
to dependent types.


### Formal Representation of the Program using Hoare Logic

#### 1. `CHECK_PRECONDITION(lambda vm: 'x' in vm.memory)`

This operation checks if the variable `'x'` is present in memory before proceeding.

- *Precondition* $\( P \)$: `'x'` must be in the memory of the virtual machine.
- *Postcondition* $\( Q \)$: The state remains unchanged if the precondition holds (no changes to the memory or stack).

{ ‘x' ∈ vm.memory } CHECK_PRECONDITION( λ vm: ‘x' ∈ vm.memory ) { True }

#### 2. `LOAD x`

This operation loads the value of `'x'` from memory and pushes it onto the stack.

- *Precondition* \( P \): `'x'` must be in the memory of the virtual machine.
- *Postcondition* \( Q \): After loading, the stack contains the value of `'x'`, and the state of the memory remains unchanged.

{ ‘x' ∈ vm.memory } LOAD ‘x' { Stack = [vm.memory[‘x']], Memory = vm.memory }

#### 3. `PUSH_LIST`

This operation pushes an empty list onto the stack.

- *Precondition* \( P \): None (this operation always succeeds).
- *Postcondition* \( Q \): The stack contains the previously pushed elements, plus a new empty list.

{ True } PUSH_LIST { Stack = Old Stack + [[]] }

#### 4. `APPEND`

This operation pops a value and a list from the stack, appends the value to the list, and pushes the updated list back onto the stack.

- *Precondition* \( P \): The stack must contain a list and a value (in this order).
- *Postcondition* \( Q \): After the operation, the list is updated with the new value appended to it.

{ Stack[-2] ∈ list ∧ Stack[-1] ∈ any type } APPEND { Stack = Old Stack[:-2] + [Stack[-2] + [Stack[-1]]] }

#### 5. `STORE lst`

This operation pops a value from the stack and stores it in memory under the variable `'lst'`.

- *Precondition* \( P \): The stack must contain a value that can be stored under the variable `'lst'`.
- *Postcondition* \( Q \): After the operation, the memory contains the value previously popped from the stack under the variable `'lst'`.

{ Stack[-1] ∈ any type } STORE ‘lst' { vm.memory[‘lst'] = Stack[-1] }

#### 6. `LOAD lst`

This operation loads the list stored under the variable `'lst'` from memory and pushes it onto the stack.

- *Precondition* \( P \): The variable `'lst'` must be present in memory.
- *Postcondition* \( Q \): After loading, the stack contains the list stored in `'lst'`.

{ ‘lst' ∈ vm.memory } LOAD ‘lst' { Stack = [vm.memory[‘lst']], Memory = vm.memory }

#### 7. `INDEX`

This operation pops an index and a list from the stack and retrieves the element at the specified index in the list.

- *Precondition* \( P \): The stack must contain a list and an integer index (in this order).
- *Postcondition* \( Q \): After the operation, the stack contains the element at the specified index from the list.

{ Stack[-2] ∈ list ∧ Stack[-1] ∈ int } INDEX { Stack = Old Stack[:-2] + [Stack[-2][Stack[-1]]] }

#### 8. `ADD`

This operation pops two integers from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result onto the stack.

- *Precondition* \( P \): The stack must contain two integers.
- *Postcondition* \( Q \): After the operation, the stack contains the result of adding the two integers.

{ Stack[-2] ∈ int ∧ Stack[-1] ∈ int } ADD { Stack = Old Stack[:-2] + [Stack[-2] + Stack[-1]] }

#### 9. `HALT`

This operation halts the execution of the program.

- *Precondition* \( P \): None (it always succeeds).
- *Postcondition* \( Q \): The program terminates, and the state of the VM is unchanged except for the fact that execution stops.

{ True } HALT { Program Execution Stops }


### Full Program Representation

We can now combine these Hoare triples to represent the full program. The execution starts
with the precondition checks and moves through each instruction.

```text
{ ‘x' ∈ vm.memory } CHECK_PRECONDITION( λ vm: ‘x' ∈ vm.memory )

{ ‘x' ∈ vm.memory } LOAD ‘x' { Stack = [5] }

{ len(vm.stack) > 0 } CHECK_POSTCONDITION( λ vm: len(vm.stack) > 0 )

{ True } PUSH_LIST { Stack = [5, []] }

{ Stack[-2] ∈ list ∧ Stack[-1] ∈ any type } APPEND { Stack = [5, [5]] }

{ Stack[-1] ∈ list } STORE ‘lst' { vm.memory[‘lst'] = [5] }

{ ‘lst' ∈ vm.memory } LOAD ‘lst' { Stack = [[5]] }
 
{ Stack[-2] ∈ list ∧ Stack[-1] ∈ int } INDEX { Stack = [5] }

{ Stack[-2] ∈ int ∧ Stack[-1] ∈ int } ADD { Stack = [10] }

{ True } HALT { Program Execution Stops }
```

This formal representation expresses the constraints (preconditions and postconditions)
for each operation using Hoare logic. It allows us to reason about the correctness of the
program step by step and enforces dependencies between different operations, similar to
dependent types in functional programming.

The program will work correctly only if x is defined in memory and has a valid value, but
the exact behavior of the program is contingent on that value. This is the crux of formal
verification: the correctness of the program depends not just on the preconditions but
also on the state and values of the system (such as the variable x).


### Project Extensions

What remains is to establish a proof of correctness; formalization alone is insufficient.
Extending the project to include such a proof requires the integration of formal methods
that rigorously validate the program’s behavior against its specification. Formal verification,
unlike mere formalization, ensures that the implementation strictly adheres to its defined
preconditions, postconditions, and invariants (such as those governing the stack or other
structures), comprehensively addressing all possible states and transitions.

A program verified in this way achieves an exceptional level of reliability. It meets not
only the typical expectation of functioning correctly for likely inputs--those scenarios
that can be covered through testing--but also guarantees correctness under all conditions
defined by the specification. This rigor is particularly vital in domains where failure
is unacceptable, such as aerospace software, medical devices, or financial systems.
Extending the project to encompass formal verification elevates its standard of precision
and trustworthiness far beyond that of conventional software engineering practices.

It is important to note, however, that fully automated solutions for formal proofs remain
an open challenge in computer science. While significant strides have been made in automating
parts of the process, complete automation for complex systems is not yet a reality.
Nonetheless, a great deal can still be achieved by leveraging existing tools and techniques
to pave the way toward more rigorous software correctness.

A common joke relating to this, suggests that a formal proof might end up containing
more errors than the program it is intended to verify ..
