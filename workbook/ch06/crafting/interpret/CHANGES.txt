CHANGES.txt FAKE LOG

Version 1.1.0 (December 8, 2024)
- Added logging to key components for better debugging and tracking.
- Integrated Python’s logging module in the Interpreter, Rasterizer, and GraphicsState classes.
- Added different log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) to capture events like drawing commands and state changes.
- Refactored the rasterizer structure.
- Introduced the Rasterizer class with clearer separation of concerns (e.g., _draw_line, _flood_fill).
- Simplified and optimized the line-drawing algorithm using Bresenham’s line algorithm.
- Fixed minor issues with path handling and stroke color application.
- Stroke and fill colors were not correctly applied in some edge cases.
- Improvement to fill handling in Rasterizer.
- Optimized the flood-fill algorithm to handle large areas more efficiently.
- Modified the GraphicsState class for better state management.
- Refined how the path is handled when restoring state.
- Added more comprehensive saving and restoring of the graphics context.
- Improved error handling in the Interpreter.
- The execute method now raises more informative error messages when an unknown command is encountered.

Version 1.0.0 (December 4, 2024)
- Initial release.
- Implemented the core graphics state management for the interpreter.
- Created basic PostScript-like commands (newpath, moveto, lineto, setrgbcolor, etc.).
- Developed a basic Rasterizer for drawing lines and filling shapes.
- Added PPM output support to export the canvas.

Version 0.9.0 (November 24, 2024)
- Pre-release.
- Initial prototype of the interpreter with basic stack operations.
- Early implementation of GraphicsState for managing stroke and fill colors.
