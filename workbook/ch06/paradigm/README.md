## Thinking Beyond Code

Programming is more than writing code that compiles or runs. It's about how we think about problems,
how we design our solutions, and how we adapt to complexity, change, and uncertainty. This section
introduces you to broader, systemic dimensions of programming--such as paradigms, abstraction,
resilience, and socio-technical design--and encourages you to reflect on how these ideas shape the
systems we build.


### Thinking Critically About Programming

Most programmers start by learning how to write code to solve specific problems. However, professional
software development involves asking deeper questions:
- What assumptions are baked into this solution?
- What tools or paradigms shape how we think about the problem?
- Could we design better abstractions tailored to the domain?

To develop this mindset, we will use a variety of real-world-inspired scenarios--like managing a
library or responding to disasters--that push us to contrast traditional approaches with language-driven
or resilience-focused alternatives.



### Programming Paradigms as Perspectives

Paradigms are not just programming languages--they are ways of thinking. We use them to frame how we define,
structure, and evolve systems.

*A programming paradigm is a lens through which we view both problems and solutions. Each lens offers benefits and trade-offs.*

Example Comparison Table:

| Paradigm            | Example Scenario         | Strengths                              | Weaknesses                           |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Traditional         | Marketplace app          | Fast setup, familiar tools             | Rigid data model, harder to evolve   |
| Language-Driven     | Biodiversity DSL         | Domain-aligned, expressive             | Complex design, slower to implement  |
| Resilience-Focused  | Disaster response system | Robust to failure, scalable under stress | Requires planning, may increase cost |



### Abstraction and Language Design

Programming languages aren't just syntax--they are expressive tools. A domain-specific language (DSL),
for instance, can capture the essence of a problem domain, making programs more communicative, adaptable, and resilient.

*A DSL defines vocabulary, grammar, and operations for a specific domain--just like natural languages, but tailored to computation.*

Activity: Design a Tiny DSL

Imagine a small domain like a library system. Define the following:
- Vocabulary: Book, Patron, Loan
- Grammar: A patron can borrow a book.
- Operations: borrow(book, patron), return(book), find_overdue()

Task: Write a few example commands in JSON or pseudocode to illustrate your design.



### Reflecting Real-World Complexity

Real systems live in the real world. That means:
- Conditions change
- Requirements evolve
- Things break

Programming should reflect this. In scenarios like healthcare or disaster management, systems
need to be flexible, observable, and resilient.

Resilience Engineering encourages you to ask: "How will my system fail? And how can I recover?"

Design Pattern Table:

| Pattern                | Description                               | Application Example                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Retry with backoff     | Retry failed requests with delay          | Network calls in disaster systems        |
| Blameless postmortem   | Review failures without assigning blame   | System crashes during emergency response |
| Chaos injection        | Simulate failure during testing           | Test resilience of healthcare APIs       |




### Programming as a Socio-Technical Practice

Software is made by people, for people, often across disciplines. Library science, ethics, and communication
studies can teach us a lot about programming.

Interdisciplinary Perspective: Building a system to coordinate volunteers in a disaster isn't just a technical
task. It involves understanding trust, reliability, and human coordination.



### Hands-On Projects and Exercises

To internalize these ideas, you'll apply them through hands-on projects.

Suggested Projects:

| Level       | Project                                    | Skills Practiced                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Beginner    | JSON-based DSL for a Library System         | Vocabulary design, abstraction            |
| Intermediate| Traditional vs DSL To-Do App Comparison     | Paradigm comparison, interface design     |
| Advanced    | Simulated Disaster System with Resilience   | Fault tolerance, observability, modeling  |




### Developing Your Programming Philosophy

To tie it all together, we'll ask you to create a manifesto or methodology based on your reflections:

__Option A: Programming Manifesto__

Write 1-2 pages summarising your core principles. For example:
- "Programming should reflect the domain, not distort it."
- "Failure is normal. Design for it."

Support each point with examples from projects or discussions.

__Option B: Methodology Design__

Choose a domain (e.g. school scheduling, restaurant reservations) and define:
- Vocabulary: What are the key concepts?
- Grammar: What are the relationships and rules?
- Operations: What actions can the system take?

Optionally, implement a prototype interpreter or script processor.



### Looking Ahead: AI and Future Paradigms

As AI systems evolve--especially large language models--they are changing how we approach programming itself.

Thought Prompt

Could a language model help you design a DSL?

Try writing a prompt for an LLM:

"Design a domain-specific language for coordinating emergency shelters during a flood."

Critique the result. What did it capture well? What did it miss?



### Summary

- Programming involves choices about representation, structure, and communication.
- Paradigms guide how we model problems and solutions.
- Language design helps make systems expressive and aligned with real-world needs.
- Resilience and adaptability are essential in real-world applications.
- Socio-technical thinking connects software to human systems and ethics.
- Your approach to programming can and should evolve--starting now!
