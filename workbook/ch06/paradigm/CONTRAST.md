## A New Paradigm vs. A Traditional Paradigm

__Scene__: *Two developers, Jordan (Language-Driven Approach) and Casey (Traditional Web Developer),
sit at a coffee table, laptops open in front of them, discussing how they would approach building a
program for their respective tasks.*
        
__Casey:__ So, I've been tasked with building this marketplace web app. You know, a platform where
users can buy and sell products. I'm planning to use React for the front end and Django for the back
end. I'll need user authentication, product listings, a shopping cart, and payment processing. Pretty
standard stuff. How about you? What's your project like?

__Jordan:__ Interesting! Sounds pretty straightforward. I'm actually working on a tool for biodiversity
research. It's a little different, though. Instead of just coding a traditional app, I'm trying to
create a custom language for describing observations and trends in biodiversity data. For example,
I need to help researchers easily represent species sightings, habitats, and environmental factors
like temperature or humidity. The challenge isn't just writing code, but defining the language they
can use to express these concepts flexibly.

__Casey:__ A custom language? That sounds .. complicated, over-complicated? I'm just focusing on the
standard stuff—getting the system working so users can buy and sell products. Time's money you know?
I'll rely on APIs for things like payment processing, and the database will store all the user and
product data. It's a bit of the usual pattern: build a structure, integrate APIs, and implement
business logic. Then, it'll just be about creating a nice user interface for the marketplace.

__Jordan:__ Well, that's where our approaches really differ. For my project, I'm not just writing
code--I'm designing the very language that will shape how users express their needs. Think of it as
creating a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for biodiversity. Rather than having researchers interact
with a database or UI, they'll use a language that's specifically tailored to their problem domain.
The goal isn't just to get the system working; it's to create a more intuitive way of describing data.

__Casey:__ So, it's less about implementing the solution directly and more about creating a framework
for people to describe their data? That's .. interesting. How do you even begin to design a language for that?

__Jordan:__ Well, the first step is defining the vocabulary--what are the key concepts in the domain?
In biodiversity, it's things like species, locations, environmental conditions, and interactions between
species. I need to decide on terms for those and figure out how they relate to each other. It's like
crafting the grammar of a language. For example, a single observation might be expressed as
"Species A was seen at Location B on Date C under Condition D." That's a basic sentence in the language.

__Casey:__ I see what you mean. But I'm still a little confused. For me, building the marketplace means
designing the system to handle data like users, products, and transactions. It's about implementing
real-world tasks with a familiar backend structure—databases, APIs, etc. I don't need to design a
language for these data points. I just need to get the code working so users can list products, manage
their carts, and check out.

__Jordan:__ Exactly! You're thinking in terms of implementation—how to use existing tools to get a working
system. But I'm focused on how to represent the data, so I'm starting with a language that lets the
user describe what they want to know. Instead of manually entering data in a rigid way, the researcher
can describe observations flexibly with the constructs we create. We'll be building operations for the
language too—things like "count species sightings," or "track population trends over time." The user can
just express their needs using these terms, and the system will handle the logic in the background.

__Casey:__ Wait, so when you say "operations," do you mean functions like "filter by species" or something?
But in my case, I'd just hook up a REST API and have users interact with a product list or payment system.

__Jordan:__ Yes, exactly! But instead of calling a REST API, the user would just "speak" the language.
For example, to count species sightings for a particular species over a range of dates, the researcher
would just specify it in the language like this:

```json
{
  "operation": "count",
  "target": "species",
  "filter": {"name": "A", "date_range": ["2020-01-01", "2023-01-01"]}
}
```

They wouldn't need to worry about database queries or how the backend is structured—just about the
meaning of the data and how it connects to their research.

__Casey:__ Ah, I think I get it. You're focusing more on flexibility in how the data can be expressed
and manipulated, whereas I'm focused on building a concrete system with predefined features. You're
creating a dynamic system that can adapt to the user's needs over time. For me, the system is more
static--once I build the core features, they generally stay the same unless I have to add new ones.

__Jordan:__ Yes, that's a good way of putting it. The language-driven approach lets users evolve the
way they work with the system, while in your approach, the system itself drives what the user can do.
For instance, if a researcher wants to track a new trend or use a different type of data, they can
just extend the language rather than changing the system itself. It's a bit like shifting from working
with a tool to shaping a medium of expression.

__Casey:__ Got it. For me, though, I still need to manage the UI and make sure the frontend integrates
well with the backend. That's where a lot of the complexity lies. And, of course, I've got to worry
about security and payment systems. You're not dealing with any of that, right?

__Jordan:__ No, my challenge is in designing the language rules and making sure the syntax and grammar
align with the needs of the domain. My users will interact with the language, not with a UI like yours.
But you're right--your approach has its own set of complexities with things like user management,
product catalogs, and payments. It's about using the tools available to you to build a robust system.

__Casey:__ So, while my approach is all about implementing solutions using existing tools, yours is
about reimagining the problem through a new lens—language. In your case, it's like giving users the
freedom to express their needs, and in my case, it's about building a system that delivers a specific
set of features.

__Jordan:__ Exactly. Both approaches are valid, but they serve different needs. Your system is designed
to solve a concrete problem, while mine is about helping users think through and express their problems
in a more natural, flexible way.

Now we leave the discussion ..


__1. The Language Approach (Domain-Specific Languages for Data and Problem-Solving)__

The dialogue contrasts how Jordan would start by designing a language to express the core
concepts and operations of the domain, while Casey would focus on building a concrete system
using existing frameworks and tools to provide users with a set of predefined functionalities.

The new concept explored involves designing a new language tailored specifically to
the domain at hand, such as biodiversity research, rather than relying on traditional
programming languages. This language could be considered a domain-specific language (DSL),
where the focus is on the vocabulary (data concepts) and the grammar (rules and relationships)
used to express and manipulate data in the domain.


Characteristics:

- *Expressiveness Over Implementation*: The primary goal is to design a language that accurately
reflects the semantic relationships and logic of the domain. The idea is to abstract away the
underlying implementation details (like databases, APIs, and algorithms) and allow domain
experts to work directly with a language that feels natural and intuitive to them.

- *Flexibility in Data Representation*: The language allows for flexible, evolving data representations.
For example, in biodiversity research, the structure of data (such as species, locations, environmental
factors) can evolve as new research questions arise. The language grows organically with the domain,
allowing users to express new concepts without needing to rework existing infrastructure.

- *Interaction via Custom Constructs*: Users interact with data through operations or verbs that
abstract the complexity of code (e.g. "count," "track trends," 2filter by species"). These operations
are part of the language itself, empowering users to ask meaningful questions and explore data
without needing to write low-level code.

- *Designed for a Specific Problem Space*: This approach is highly specialized. It's focused on
understanding how to represent the problem space itself (e.g., biodiversity observations) rather
than how to build a system for solving that problem in a general-purpose manner. It's about shaping
the way we think and talk about the problem (the language) rather than focusing on the mechanical
implementation.


__2. Traditional Approach (Building a Marketplace Web Program)__

The traditional approach, such as building a marketplace web program, typically involves using
general-purpose programming languages (think JavaScript, Python, Ruby ..) in their natural use
along with various frameworks and libraries to build a solution. In this case, the problem of
creating a marketplace involves solving several concrete tasks, such as managing user accounts,
processing payments, and listing products.

Characteristics:

- *Implementation-Driven*: The focus here is on creating a working system by implementing logic
through code, using APIs and libraries to manage features like authentication, payment processing,
or product listings. The main concern is usually how to get the system functioning and scalable
rather than how to express the problem domain itself.

- *Use of Predefined Tools*: In this approach, you typically rely on existing libraries, APIs,
and frameworks for standard tasks like CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), routing,
and data management. You're working within the constraints of these tools and the programming
language's syntax.

- *Rigid Data Models*: Traditional web applications are often built around rigid data models
(such as relational databases or predefined schemas) that define how data should be structured
and manipulated. Changing the way data is represented or extending the system requires modifying
these structures or database schemas.

- *User Interaction via UI/UX*: The goal of building a marketplace web program is usually to
create a user interface (UI) that is intuitive for users to interact with. The interaction is
generally through web forms, buttons, search functionality, and so on, with the back-end code
handling the logic of managing users, products, and transactions.

- *General-Purpose Tools for General-Purpose Problems*: Traditional approaches use widely accepted
general-purpose tools to handle generic problems (like user authentication, data storage, and
payment systems). While the approach is efficient for many common tasks, it often lacks the depth
and specificity needed for domain-specific problems.


__3. Contrasting the Approaches__

The core difference is that the language-driven approach is more about creating an abstraction
for how we express and reason about data, while the traditional approach is focused on implementing
concrete solutions using existing tools and systems. For instance, in the marketplace example,
the programmer might choose a web framework like Django or Ruby on Rails and build out user stories
through code, whereas in the language-driven approach, you'd focus on creating a set of constructs
that help a user or researcher express their data and explore questions around it.

 In a traditional marketplace application, users interact with a predefined system (a shopping cart,
 payment flow, etc.) that has been designed to handle specific tasks. In contrast, with a domain-specific
 language, users and domain experts can be more directly involved in defining how the data is represented
 and how it should evolve. In the case of biodiversity, the domain expert (could be a biologist) might
define what constitutes an observation or a trend without needing to involve a programmer.

The language approach offers a great deal of flexibility, as it can adapt to changes in the problem space
over time. As research needs evolve, the language can evolve. On the other hand, traditional web development
is more rigid and often requires more upfront design, as modifying the data model or the way a marketplace
functions might require reworking the entire backend system or database.

The traditional approach might offer faster development times for creating a working system, especially
using existing frameworks, libraries, and APIs. However, this comes at the cost of flexibility. In
contrast, the language-driven approach might take longer to develop but will allow for greater
long-term adaptability and natural evolution of the system in response to changes in the problem domain.

The marketplace application, while complex in its business logic (handling payments, managing inventory, ..),
doesn't require the same depth of abstraction in how the problem is described as the biodiversity data
language. The marketplace problem is highly task-driven, whereas the biodiversity problem is domain-driven,
and crafting a language for it requires capturing nuances and relationships in data.


### Summary:

Traditional programming (marketplace web program) is about building a system that solves a problem using
established tools and frameworks, focusing on practical implementation and integrating existing APIs.

Language design for data focuses on the abstraction of the problem space itself, where the goal is to
define and manipulate data through custom constructs (a language) that reflect the complexity of the domain.

In essence, the language-based approach is more about designing how to think and talk about a problem,
while the traditional approach is about building an application that solves the problem using available technology.

With the advancement of future LLMs and AI, the balance could shift.
