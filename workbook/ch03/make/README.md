## Tutorial to 'make' and 'Makefiles'

The 'make' is a build automation tool commonly used in software development.
It uses a 'Makefile' to define a set of rules for building and managing
dependencies (in a project). It is especially helpful when your
project involves multiple files and complex compilation steps.


### What is make?

- Purpose: Automate the process of compiling and building software.
- How it works: make reads instructions from a Makefile, which specifies:
- Targets: The files or actions you want to build or perform.
- Dependencies: Files or prerequisites required to build a target.
- Commands: Steps to generate the target from its dependencies.


#### Basic Structure of a Makefile

```makefile
target: dependencies
    command
```

- `target`: The file to build (e.g., an executable, object file, or document).
- `dependencies`: Files or targets needed to build the target.
- `command`: Shell commands executed to create the target.


1. A Simple Example

Suppose we have a C program 'main.c':

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, Make!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Without make you compile it manually using:

```shell
gcc -o main main.c
```

With make create a file named 'Makefile' (no file extension):

```makefile
main: main.c
    gcc -o main main.c
```

To build the program, simply run 'make' at the command line.

- `main`: This is the target. It will be created when you run make.
- `main.c`: This is the *dependency*. If main.c is modified, the target will be rebuilt.
- `gcc -o main main.c`: The command to compile the program.

2. Adding Cleanup

You can add a clean target to remove build files:

```makefile
main: main.c
    gcc -o main main.c

clean:
    rm -f main
```

Run make clean to delete the main executable:

```shell
make clean
```

3. Variables in Makefiles

You can simplify your Makefile by using variables:

```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall
TARGET = main

$(TARGET): main.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) main.c

clean:
    rm -f $(TARGET)
```

- `$(CC)`: Refers to the gcc compiler.
- `$(CFLAGS)`: Compiler flags (e.g., -Wall enables warnings).
- `$(TARGET)`: A custom variable holding the target name.

4. Handling Multiple Files

For larger projects, source files are often split across multiple .c files, main.c:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "hello.h"
int main() {
    print_hello();
    return 0;
}
```

hello.c:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void print_hello() {
    printf("Hello from another file!\n");
}
```

hello.h:

```c
void print_hello();
```

To compile manually:

```shell
gcc -c main.c
gcc -c hello.c
gcc -o main main.o hello.o
```

With 'make', the 'Makefile' simplifies this process:

```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall
TARGET = main
OBJS = main.o hello.o

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJS)

main.o: main.c hello.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

hello.o: hello.c hello.h
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c hello.c

clean:
    rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJS)
```

Run make to build the program, and make clean to remove generated files.

5. Automatic Dependency Handling

Makefiles can automatically detect changes in dependencies using special features using pattern rules:

```makefile
%.o: %.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<
```
Updated Makefile:

```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall
TARGET = main
OBJS = main.o hello.o

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJS)

%.o: %.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

clean:
    rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJS)
```

- `%.o: %.c`: A pattern rule for generating .o files from .c files.
- `$<`: Refers to the first dependency (e.g. main.c for main.o).

6. Using Built-in Functions

Makefiles include functions for string manipulation and other utilities. Common ones include:
- `$@`: The target name.
- `$^`: All dependencies.
- `$<`: The first dependency.

Example:

```makefile
$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^
```

- Build `$(TARGET)` using `$(CC)` with all dependencies `$^`.

7. Phony Targets

Some targets, like 'clean', donâ€™t correspond to actual files. To prevent conflicts, you can declare them phony:

```makefile
.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJS)
```

8. Advanced: Conditional Compilation

You can include optional features using conditions:

```makefile
DEBUG = 1

ifeq ($(DEBUG), 1)
    CFLAGS += -g
else
    CFLAGS += -O2
endif
```

Run make with custom variables:

```shell
make DEBUG=0
```

#### Summary

|Command|	Description|
|--|--|
|make|	Build the default target (first in the file).|
|make <target>|	Build a specific target.|
|make clean|	Execute the clean target.|
|make -n|	Show the commands without running them.|
|make -j <N>|	Run make with N parallel jobs.|


#### Recommendations

1.	Organize Your Rules: List targets logically, and use comments to document the purpose of each.
2.	Keep It DRY: Use variables and pattern rules to minimize repetition.
3.	Test Frequently: Check that changes to source files trigger only necessary recompilation.
4.	Leverage .PHONY: Avoid issues with non-file targets like clean.
