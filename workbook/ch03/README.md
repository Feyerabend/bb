## Debugging, Optimisations and Tests

This section of the book delves into debugging, optimisation/optimization, and testing
in programming, highlighting their critical role in software development and offering
detailed insights into each concept.

In this workbook, you are encouraged to explore and refine your own set of tools, choosing
those best suited to the task at hand while also broadening your repertoire. From the less
conventional *Time Travel Debugging* (TTD) to more traditional testing techniques--including
unit, integration, and functional tests--you are invited to study their applications and
integrate them into your workflow as you see fit.

A brief introduction to machine learning is also provided, featuring tools like the
*confusion matrix* for analysis and an exploration. The Q-algorithm and reinforcement
learning are example of machine learning, shown through the classic example of tic-tac-toe.
These serve as stepping stones into the broader field of intelligent systems.

Additionally, the discussion reflects on the broader context of computing. Historically,
the development of computing technology has been deeply intertwined with military applications,
which remain a significant force in shaping the field. The workbook encourages you to consider
the evolving role of artificial intelligence and speculate on the potential futures it may
bring, engaging critically with the ethical and societal dimensions of AI development.
