## The Perceptron

The perceptron is one of the earliest machine learning models, originally introduced
by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. It was designed as a simplified model of how neurons in
the brain process information. The perceptron is a type of binary classifier, meaning
it decides between two categories by applying a weighted sum to inputs and passing the
result through an activation function (usually a step function).

While the original perceptron could only solve linearly separable problems, it laid
the foundation for modern neural networks. The introduction of the multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) and backpropagation in the 1980s allowed for more complex decision boundaries,
leading to deep learning as we know it today.


### Overview

The program 'percept.py' program builds a simple multi-class perceptron to classify
shapes (circles, squares, and lines) from 8×8 pixel images.

The code is split into three main parts:
1. Image Generation: Creates synthetic training images of circles, squares, and lines.
2. Perceptron Model: Implements a multi-class perceptron with weight updates.
3. Training and Testing: Loads image data, trains the perceptron, and evaluates accuracy.



__1. Perceptron Model__

This is the heart of the program. The perceptron model is responsible for learning and
predicting shapes based on the pixel data.

```python
class Perceptron:
    def __init__(self, input_size, num_classes, l2_lambda=0.01):
        self.num_classes = num_classes
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.weights = [[random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(input_size)] for _ in range(num_classes)]
        self.bias = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for _ in range(num_classes)]
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.l2_lambda = l2_lambda  # regularisation strength
```
- input_size: Number of pixels in the input image (8×8 = 64).
- num_classes: Number of shapes (circle, square, line → 3 classes).
- self.weights: A list of weight vectors for each class, initialised randomly.
- self.bias: A separate bias term for each class.
- self.l2_lambda: L2 regularisation strength to prevent overfitting.


__2. Activation Function & Prediction__

The perceptron uses a step activation function to determine class labels.

```python
def activation(self, x):
    return 1 if x >= 0 else 0
```

This function returns 1 for positive values and 0 otherwise.

```python
def predict(self, inputs):
    scores = [sum(w * i for w, i in zip(self.weights[c], inputs)) + self.bias[c] for c in range(self.num_classes)]
    return scores.index(max(scores))
```
- Computes the score for each class using the weighted sum of inputs plus bias.
- Returns the class with the highest score (argmax).


__3. Training Algorithm__

```python
def train(self, training_data, labels, epochs):
    for _ in range(epochs):
        for inputs, label in zip(training_data, labels):
            prediction = self.predict(inputs)
            if prediction != label:
                # update weights with L2 regularisation
                for i in range(len(self.weights[label])):
                    self.weights[label][i] += self.learning_rate * (inputs[i] - self.l2_lambda * self.weights[label][i])
                    self.weights[prediction][i] -= self.learning_rate * (inputs[i] + self.l2_lambda * self.weights[prediction][i])
                # update biases
                self.bias[label] += self.learning_rate
                self.bias[prediction] -= self.learning_rate
```
1. Iterates through the dataset for multiple epochs to refine weights.
2. Makes a prediction and compares it to the correct label.
3. If wrong, updates weights:
- Increases weights of the correct class.
- Decreases weights of the wrongly predicted class.
- Uses L2 regularisation to prevent excessive weight growth.
4. Bias updates work the same way to shift decision boundaries.


__4. Image Generation (Synthetic Training Data)__

The dataset consists of binary 8×8 images representing three shapes: circle, square, and line.


#### Generating a Circle

```python
def generate_circle_image(size=8, noise_level=0.1):
    image = [[0] * size for _ in range(size)]
    cx, cy = random.randint(size // 4, 3 * size // 4), random.randint(size // 4, 3 * size // 4)
    radius = random.randint(size // 4, size // 3)

    for x in range(size):
        for y in range(size):
            if (x - cx) ** 2 + (y - cy) ** 2 <= radius ** 2:
                image[x][y] = 1

    add_noise(image, noise_level)
    return image
```
- Creates a blank grid (0s for black pixels).
- Picks a random center (cx, cy) and random radius.
- Fills pixels inside the circle using the equation of a circle:
    - Calls add_noise() to introduce random noise.


#### Generating a Square

```python
def generate_square_image(size=8, noise_level=0.1):
    image = [[0] * size for _ in range(size)]
    start_x, start_y = random.randint(1, size // 3), random.randint(1, size // 3)
    end_x, end_y = random.randint(2 * size // 3, size - 1), random.randint(2 * size // 3, size - 1)

    for x in range(start_x, end_x):
        for y in range(start_y, end_y):
            image[x][y] = 1

    add_noise(image, noise_level)
    return image
```
- Picks random start and end points for the square.
- Fills the bounding box with 1s to create the square.


#### Generating a Line

```python
def generate_line_image(size=8, noise_level=0.1):
    image = [[0] * size for _ in range(size)]
    slope = random.uniform(-1, 1)
    intercept = random.randint(0, size - 1)

    for x in range(size):
        y = int(slope * x + intercept)
        if 0 <= y < size:
            image[x][y] = 1

    add_noise(image, noise_level)
    return image
```
- Generates a random slope and intercept for a line equation:
    - Rounds y to the nearest pixel and sets it to 1.


#### Adding Noise

```python
def add_noise(image, noise_level=0.1):
    size = len(image)
    num_pixels = int(size * size * noise_level)

    for _ in range(num_pixels):
        x, y = random.randint(0, size - 1), random.randint(0, size - 1)
        image[x][y] = 1 if image[x][y] == 0 else 0
```
- Randomly flips a percentage of pixels to simulate noise.


__5. Training and Evaluating the Perceptron__

```python
generate_and_save_data()

input_size = 64  # 8x8 image
perceptron = Perceptron(input_size, num_classes=3)
train_data, train_labels, test_data, test_labels = load_all_data()
perceptron.train(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10)

correct_predictions = sum(1 for inputs, label in zip(test_data, test_labels) if perceptron.predict(inputs) == label)
accuracy = correct_predictions / len(test_labels) * 100
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%")
```
- Generates training/testing data.
- Loads and flattens images into feature vectors.
- Trains the perceptron for 10 epochs.
- Evaluates accuracy on test data.
