## Exploring the virtual machine landscape

This chapter emphasizes the concept of 'machines' as a foundation for abstract reasoning, particularly
in the context of virtual machines (VMs). Virtual machines serve as a conceptual and practical bridge,
enabling us to model and understand the behavior of programming languages. By studying virtual machines,
one can explore both the specific implementations of various programming paradigms—such as functional,
object-oriented, or imperative languages—and the architectural differences in how these machines are
designed and constructed.

In this context, a virtual machine is understood primarily as a model for implementing and interpreting
programming languages. This allows us to delve into the essence of computing as a software-building
activity, where the machine is not just a physical entity but also an abstract computational model.
From this perspective, the focus shifts to how software interfaces with and shapes the underlying
computational logic. In contrast, other approaches, such as those rooted in hardware engineering,
might prioritize a bottom-up view, starting with the physical properties of circuits and processors.

A pivotal example for students to study is the 'von Neumann machine,' which serves as the archetype
for most real-world computers today. This model, based on the principles of stored-program architecture,
highlights the interplay between memory, processing, and instruction flow. Understanding the von Neumann
architecture provides a foundational lens for grasping the limitations and possibilities inherent in most
modern computing systems. Optionally comparing this with alternative architectures, such as the Harvard
architecture or parallel processing machines, further broadens the understanding of how virtual machines
can diverge based on their design goals. We do not however go into details on those approches here,
but remains open for further explorations.

By engaging with these concepts, students of computers and programming can gain a richer appreciation
of how virtual machines embody different paradigms, allowing us to reason about programming languages
and computation more broadly. This exploration serves not only to deepen understanding of specific
programming models but also thus to illuminate the broader landscape of computational theory and practice.
