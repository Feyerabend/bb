## High-Level Languages in Hardware

The idea of implementing high-level programming languages directly into hardware, such as
Java, Lisp, Prolog or Forth, has been explored historically in several forms. This concept,
known as "hardware acceleration" or "hardware implementation of languages," aims to take
advantage of specialised hardware to execute high-level language instructions directly,
rather than relying solely on general-purpose processors and traditional compilers.


### Java Chips

Java was originally designed as an object-oriented, platform-independent programming language
that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). However, the idea of running Java directly on
hardware has been explored in several ways, especially for embedded systems and specialised
applications.

The idea of putting the JVM directly into hardware (such as on an embedded processor) has
been explored. This would allow Java programs to be executed natively without the overhead
of interpreting bytecode through the standard JVM. Java chips like these could provide better
performance for Java applications while maintaining platform independence.

Specialised hardware could be designed to accelerate certain aspects of Java execution,
such as garbage collection, method invocation, or object management. Custom hardware for
Java could offload these tasks, improving performance for Java applications, especially
in resource-constrained environments.


But the JVM's abstraction layer, which is designed to run Java bytecode on any platform,
is inherently complex. Implementing the entire JVM in hardware would require designing
a chip that supports all of its features, including dynamic class loading, garbage collection,
and multi-threading, which are difficult to optimise in hardware.

One of the key features of Java is its platform independence. Having Java run directly on
hardware would somewhat negate this characteristic, as the hardware would need to be
specifically tailored to execute Java applications. Other obstactles might be the possible
evolution of the bytecode or other essential parts, that impact the evolution of the
language, but is restriced due to limitations of updating the hardware.

Some embedded devices do use Java processors, which are specialized processors that run
Java bytecode directly or use optimized JVMs for embedded systems. These systems are used
in IoT devices, set-top boxes, and other low-power, resource-constrained environments
where the overhead of a full JVM might be too costly.


### Forth

Forth is a stack-based, procedural programming language that is particularly well-suited
for embedded systems and hardware control. It has been explored in hardware in a more
direct way than languages like Pascal or Java due to its simplicity and its ability to
operate very close to the hardware.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the concept of a "Forth machine" was developed, where a processor
was designed specifically to execute Forth words (the basic units of a Forth program)
These Forth machines had hardware that directly executed the stack operations and other
core constructs of the Forth language.

There were also processors developed, such as the "Forth chips" or Forth processors,
that were optimised to run Forth programs directly. These chips were quite simple
in design compared to general-purpose CPUs, and they could execute Forth programs
much faster than interpreting them on a general-purpose machine.

The Forth language, being based on a stack model, was naturally suited to hardware
implementation because it involved a small, fixed set of operations that could be
directly mapped to hardware. For example, pushing and popping data from the stack
could be implemented in hardware, speeding up execution significantly.

Similar to Pascal implementations in hardware, Forth machines were specialised and
could only execute Forth programs. They were *not suitable* for general-purpose
computing. As general-purpose processors became faster and more efficient, the need
for dedicated Forth machines declined. Today, the Forth language is used mainly in
embedded systems, where its simplicity and low resource requirements still make it a good fit.


### Lisp Machine Lisp (in Lisp Machines)

The Lisp machine was a family of computers designed specifically to run the Lisp programming language.
Developed in the 1970s and 1980s by organisations such as MIT's AI Lab, Symbolics, and Lisp Machines, Inc.,
these machines were purpose-built to support the specific needs of Lisp, which was heavily used in
artificial intelligence (AI) research at the time. Unlike traditional computers that ran general-purpose
operating systems and programming languages, Lisp machines were optimised for Lisp, offering native
support for garbage collection, dynamic typing, and other features that made Lisp particularly suitable
for symbolic reasoning and AI.

The Lisp machine was a custom-designed computer, including both specialised processors and memory systems
tailored to the efficient execution of Lisp code. It featured an instruction set optimised for the
operations common in Lisp, such as list processing, recursive function calls, and garbage collection.
One of the key features of the Lisp machine was its ability to support interactive development, where
users could write and modify code in real-time without needing to recompile or restart the system.
The architecture was designed to efficiently handle symbolic computation, which is central to the Lisp
language, making it particularly suitable for AI and research in computer science.

The Lisp machine and Lisp Machine Lisp allowed programmers to exploit Lisp's full potential by providing
hardware acceleration for its features. This was a significant departure from general-purpose computers,
where Lisp had to be interpreted or run on top of more general hardware.
Lisp machines were thus widely used in AI research and other symbolic computing applications.

Despite its success in niche markets, the Lisp machine ultimately faced challenges.
The high cost of specialized hardware, along with the rise of general-purpose computers and workstations
(especially from companies like Sun Microsystems and Apollo), led to the eventual decline of Lisp machines.
The performance of Lisp on general-purpose systems improved, making specialised Lisp hardware less relevant.

But the Lisp machine also influenced later developments in FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and hardware
accelerators, where hardware could be optimised for specific languages or workloads. The Symbolics company
continued to influence the development of AI systems and workstations.

From a historical perspective, the Lisp machine represents one of the earliest attempts at
hardware-accelerated, domain-specific computation.


### Prolog

Prolog, a logic programming language, has been explored in hardware accelerators due to its distinct
execution model, which relies on pattern matching, unification, and backtracking. These features are
computationally intensive on general-purpose processors, making Prolog an intriguing candidate for
hardware implementation.

Prolog's execution model, particularly unification and backtracking, has been implemented directly in
hardware to optimize performance. These implementations focus on custom circuits designed to handle the
unification process more efficiently than software. Unification is a core operation in Prolog, involving
comparing and binding variables during pattern matching. There is also hardware mechanisms to store and
restore computational states, enabling efficient traversal of the solution space in Prolog programs.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Prolog-specific hardware, known as Prolog machines, was developed to execute
Prolog programs natively. The Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) is an abstract machine that standardises
Prolog's execution model. Several hardware implementations of WAM were created to accelerate Prolog's
execution by translating the abstract operations of WAM directly into hardware logic.
Custom processors were designed to interpret and execute WAM instructions directly, bypassing the
need for traditional software interpreters.

Prolog hardware accelerators have been explored for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing
(NLP), and symbolic computation, hence similar applications have used LISP.

While hardware accelerators for Prolog offered significant performance improvements for specific tasks, their
adoption faced challenges. Improvements in general-purpose CPUs and GPUs diminished the relative advantage of
Prolog-specific hardware. Developing custom hardware for a niche language was costly and less flexible than
software implementations.



### Conclusion and the Future

Historically, direct hardware implementations of high-level languages targeted niche
applications, such as expert systems or symbolic processing. While these efforts achieved
limited adoption due to the complexity of hardware and software integration, the
fundamental idea of language-driven hardware persists in modern accelerators.

The future of high-level language hardware acceleration may not follow the paths of
the early attempts of languages on hardware, but could emerge through new paradigms.
AI frameworks like *TensorFlow* and *PyTorch* are already leveraging hardware-specific
accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, designed for efficient matrix operations and
neural network workloads. This trend points to a future where languages or frameworks
are *tightly coupled* with specialised hardware to maximise performance.

FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) offer another promising direction. Unlike 
dedicated chips, FPGAs can be reprogrammed to implement hardware acceleration
for specific high-level languages or frameworks. This flexibility bridges the gap
between general-purpose processors and custom-designed hardware. High-level parallel
programming languages like *OpenCL*, *CUDA*, and even domain-specific languages can be
mapped onto FPGAs, enabling tailored performance without the high costs of
designing dedicated chips.
