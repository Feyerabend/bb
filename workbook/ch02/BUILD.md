## Build your own VM or interpreter

When building your own very simple virtual machine (VM), there are several key
considerations to keep in mind. A simple VM is also close to the machine, and
in principle to an imperative language. To build for an object-oriented language,
or functional language approach of the VM, see [VMBUILD2](./VMBUILD2.md).


### Building a simple VM with an imperative programming model

Many imperative languages closely align with the fundamental operations of a
computer, which is why their structure feels intuitive when dealing with hardware-level
instructions. Imperative languages, such as C, but also aspects of Python, or Java
directly reflect the way a computer executes commands: sequentially, step-by-step,
and by modifying memory states. These languages often map to common processor operations
like loading values, performing arithmetic, and storing results, making them efficient
for representing tasks that require control over system resources, memory management,
or procedural logic.

In essence, imperative programming mirrors the von Neumann architecture, where a program
is seen as a sequence of instructions that manipulate a shared memory space. Concepts
like loops, conditionals, and variable assignments mimic how a processor reads, modifies,
and writes data at each cycle. This is why imperative languages often feel close to the
``metal'' of a machine: they embody the same flow of operations—fetching instructions,
executing them, and storing results—that hardware follows.


#### Instruction set

* *Instruction types*: Decide on the set of operations your VM will support (e.g.
  arithmetic operations, control flow, memory access). Common instructions include
  PUSH, POP, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, JUMP, and CALL.

* *Instruction format*: Determine the format of your instructions. Instructions can
  be single-byte or multi-byte, with some instructions requiring operands (like
  values or addresses).

* *Bytecode representation*: Represent the instructions in a compact form, typically
  as bytecode. This bytecode is what your VM will interpret and execute.


#### Stack vs. register-based achitecture

* *Stack-based VM*: Uses a stack to store values and execute operations (e.g. Java
  Virtual Machine). Instructions manipulate the stack directly (e.g. PUSH 5, ADD).

* *Register-based VM*: Uses a set of registers to store intermediate values
  (e.g. Lua VM). Instructions specify operations on registers (e.g. MOV R1, 5, ADD R1, R2).

A stack-based VM is simpler to implement for beginners, as it eliminates the need for
managing multiple registers and instruction complexity.


#### Memory management

* *Stack for function calls*: Implement a stack to store function call frames and local variables.

* *Heap for dynamic memory*: If your VM needs dynamic memory allocation, you may need to implement a simple heap.

* *Instruction pointer*: Keep track of the current instruction being executed using a program counter (PC) or instruction pointer (IP).

* *Memory model*: Determine how memory is represented in your VM (e.g. separate sections for code, data, and stack).


#### Arithmetic and logic operations

* Implement basic arithmetic (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV) and logic operations (AND, OR, NOT).

* Make sure to handle potential issues such as division by zero and overflows.


#### Control flow

* *Jump and conditional instructions*: Implement jumps (JMP, JMP_IF) to enable loops and conditional branching.

* *Function calls and return*: If you're implementing functions, you'll need instructions to call (CALL) and return (RET) from functions, managing a call stack.


#### Error handling

* Implement basic error handling, such as checking for stack underflow (when popping an empty stack) or invalid memory access.

* Detect and handle illegal instructions (e.g. if a bytecode sequence contains an unknown instruction).


#### Input/Output

* *I/O operations*: Add instructions for basic input/output, such as PRINT or READ. This can help in debugging and interacting with the VM.


#### Instruction execution loop

* Implement a loop that fetches the current instruction, decodes it, executes it, and advances the instruction pointer.
  This is often referred to as the fetch-decode-execute cycle.


#### Portability

* Consider how easy it is to port your VM to different platforms. A well-designed VM abstracts away the hardware, so it
  should be straightforward to implement on various architectures.


#### Optimization (optional)

* *Performance considerations*: While a simple VM might not need heavy optimization, you can explore optimizing frequently
  executed instructions, minimizing memory access, or caching certain computations.

* *Garbage collection (optional)*: If your VM uses dynamic memory, consider implementing a basic garbage collector to manage memory usage.


##### Example: considerations for a simple stack-based VM:

1. Instruction set:
   * PUSH <value>: Push a value onto the stack.
   * POP: Pop the top value off the stack.
   * ADD: Pop two values, add them, and push the result.
   * SUB: Pop two values, subtract them, and push the result.
   * PRINT: Print the top value from the stack.

2. Memory:
  * Stack: Use an array or slice to store the stack values.
  * Instruction Pointer: Use an integer to track the current instruction's location in the bytecode.

3. Execution loop:
  * Loop through the bytecode, interpreting each instruction and updating the stack accordingly.

##### Example: instruction execution loop (in pseudo-code):

```
while instruction_pointer < bytecode_length:
    instruction = bytecode[instruction_pointer]
    switch instruction:
        case PUSH:
            value = bytecode[instruction_pointer + 1]
            stack.push(value)
            instruction_pointer += 2
        case ADD:
            a = stack.pop()
            b = stack.pop()
            stack.push(a + b)
            instruction_pointer += 1
        case PRINT:
            value = stack.pop()
            print(value)
            instruction_pointer += 1
        ...
```

By considering these points, you'll be equipped to design and implement a simple virtual machine,
capable of executing basic operations and providing a strong foundation for more complex systems.
